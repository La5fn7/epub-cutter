<p>CONCLUSIONS AND POTENTIAL APPLICATIONS So, what is pitch? Pitch is many things. Pitch is a way to order periodic sounds, and changes along this continuum are a potent tool in coding expression into music. Pitch exists in opposition to noise. And pitch can be thought of as a way to parse a single sound into lower and higher frequency ranges that elicit qualitatively opposable percepts. At the very least, I encourage the reader to notice that the idea of pitch is complex, which complicates its utility as a control criterion in the definition of timbre. If pitch is considered a common feature of two otherwise differently timbred sounds, how do we account for the various ways in which pitch and noise may manifest within a single sound? We can then move beyond our initial definition that pitch is how humans perceive frequency to appreciate that this only tells us that pitch is not frequency. This does not actually articulate what pitch is. Understanding pitch in this broad manner allows one to parse out parts of the spectrum that are not pitch but are rather contrasting, unresolved noise. We can observe, for example, that basic qualities in a voice change with pitch by observing how spectral regions of pitch and pitch-lessness intersect with the SFC. At a low fundamental, the SFC itself may in fact qualify as noise. At a high enough fundamental, the SFC may become part of the pitch percept. Pitch may also be generated by the periodicity of a resonance, independent of the behavior of the vocal folds. See the exploration of formant tuning and overtone singing in chapter 6 for a more thorough exploration of this idea. This framework also encourages one to extend the default upper frequency limit of 4 to 5 kHz set by most spectrographs. I argue that it is possible to find meaningful spectral information above this preset range, especially at high pitches. Because we have learned to characterize the perceptual distinction between the pitched and pitch-less portions of the spectrum, we may now begin to train our ears to hear whether the spectrogram is leaving information off the top of what it displays.</p>

<p>This basic idea of pitch versus pitch-lessness is necessary in part because it sketches out a basic scaffold to account for the opposing qualities that may exist within a single vocal tone. Noticing this foundational contrast is an important first step. Real insight as a voice teacher comes from attaching this perceptual quality to the functional adjustments of the singer, which will be explored in greater detail in chapters 11 and 12. In the coming chapters I will elaborate on this basic oppositional framework. But noticing the contrast is an important first step. The way in which the voice pedagogy and vocology literature typically presents the idea of pitch risks limiting our potential for intimately understanding the phenomenon of a singing voice. For this reason, the ways in which we address the perceptual qualities of auditory roughness and tone color will undergo similar consideration.</p>
