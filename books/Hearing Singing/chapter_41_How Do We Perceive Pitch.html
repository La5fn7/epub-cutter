<p>HOW DO WE PERCEIVE PITCH? There are two theories that each partially account for the phenomenon of pitch perception: the place theory and the timing (or temporal) theory. The place theory assumes that the cochlea performs its frequency filtering on a periodic pressure pattern somewhat like a Fourier transform does, by breaking the complex pattern down into harmonic constituents, each of which stimulates a different physical location along the basilar membrane in the cochlea. By contrast, the timing theory assumes that it is the auditory cortex that extracts pitch from the delay between successive transient peaks in the pressure wave. In a voice, these successive transient peaks typically take place at the start of each period. Both of these explanations carry limitations. The place theory does a poor job of explaining phenomena like the missing fundamental,6 where pitch perception is robust in the absence of energy at the frequency that is equivalent to the fundamental itself.7 The analog telephone system leveraged this phenomenon to convey the pitch percept whenever the fundamental was below 300 Hz. Music played back on small speakers similarly elicits the pitch of a wide range of sounds despite its poor low- frequency response. Or consider the unamplified voice of a bass singer singing a very low pitch in a large space. Very little of their fundamental will radiate to audience members. Not only is their lowest vocal tract resonance unlikely to be lower in frequency than around 270 Hz,8 their lowest frequency energy will be the least directional part of their sound.9 Since the place on the basilar membrane stimulated by the fundamental does not appear necessary for pitch perception, the place theory appears to be an incomplete explanation. Likewise, one limitation of the timing theory is that the auditory cortex cannot extract accurate pitch information from a periodic sound whose period is shorter than 0.2 millisecond. This is equivalent to a fundamental (1f o) above 5 kHz (1,000 ms / 0.2 ms = 5,000 Hz). Because pitch accuracy is known to decrease above 5 kHz, any sense of pitch in this high-frequency range likely has a different explanation.10</p>

<p>I will leave an exhaustive discussion of the neuromechanical processes leading to the cognitive experience of pitch to readers who wish to explore the literature cited in the endnotes. For now, it is enough to understand that neither theory fully accounts for the pitch percept.</p>
