<p>5 Pitch There is perhaps no aspect of music more important than pitch. It is notoriously prescribed by composers and meaningfully recomposed by performers. It would be nearly impossible to move through a day without experiencing pitch, even if just in the call of a bird, the buzz of a fly‚Äôs wings, or the beep of an alarm clock. Yet what is pitch? Many musicians are aware that pitch has a relationship to frequency, usually measured in repetitions of a pattern per second, known as hertz (Hz). Even nonmusicians are typically aware of the central idea captured in the official definition of pitch: ‚Äúthe auditory attribute of sound according to which sounds can be ordered on a scale from low to high.‚Äù1 Frequency is objectively measurable, while pitch is how the brain perceives frequency. In the voice pedagogy community, pitch is typically differentiated from frequency by its perceptual nature. Scott McCoy (2019) offers a concise example of how this has been expressed in the voice pedagogy literature: Frequency is an objective measurement of vibrations per second; pitch, however, is a subjective perception that can be influenced by factors ranging from vibrato to timbre and intensity.2 This definition tells us more about what frequency is not, rather than what pitch is.</p>

<p>I would like to draw your attention to three nuanced ideas that coexist in the idea of pitch: 1. Pitch is an organizing property of sound. We may compare two periodic sounds and order them as lower or higher than each other along the pitch continuum. For example, C5 (an octave above middle C) is higher than C4 (middle C). C5 is also higher than B4 (a seventh above middle C), but by a smaller increment in the pitch space. Please note that few musical sounds are perfectly periodic, but quasi- periodicity is sufficient for pitch perception. 2. Some sounds are pitched, while others are noise. Pitched sounds feature the periodic (regular) repetition of pressure changes. ‚ÄúNoise‚Äù in the scientific sense features aperiodic pressure changes. Consider a piano tone and a cymbal crash. The two are qualitatively different. The sound of a cymbal does not just lack pitch (periodicity); it is a kind of noise (aperiodicity). Some definitions of noise include a cultural judgment based on whether the sound is unwanted or a nuisance. This is important to know, but I will not use the term in this way. 3. The idea of pitch contains complex oppositions. When we consider a given sound, we can understand that some qualitative aspects of that sound may convey pitch, while other qualitative aspects of that sound may not. Within any single pitched sound, a portion of the spectrum has the potential to elicit a pitch percept and a separate portion may not. If a</p>

<p>sound has pitch, the potential still exists for some portion of that sound to be pitch-less noise. This chapter will explore the qualitative aspects of pitch and suggest ways to locate these complex qualities in a spectrum or spectrogram.</p>
