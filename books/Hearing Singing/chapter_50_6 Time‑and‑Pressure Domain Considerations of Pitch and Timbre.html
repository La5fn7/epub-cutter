<p>6 Time‚Äëand‚ÄëPressure Domain Considerations of Pitch and Timbre Any periodic sound can be explained as a spectrum of discrete frequency components even though it is actually a complex, repeating pressure pattern. This is a tension that exists within our pedagogic models. You may recall that while chapter 3 foregrounds the utility of understanding the voice outside the constraints of a Fourier transform, the examples in chapter 5 are illustrated using Fourier transform‚Äìbased spectra and spectrograms. In other words, while chapter 3 discussed the physical (time, flow, and pressure) reality of voice production, chapter 5 frequently used the language of a harmonic spectrum. Sometimes a spectrum or spectrogram set to display harmonics best illustrates a concept. At other times a waveform brings more clarity. Respectively, these two approaches correspond to the steady-state or harmonic theory of voice production and the transient or inharmonic theory of voice production. Both approaches are useful ways to model aspects of the same physical phenomenon of voice production. Both exclude information. The overlapping history of these acoustical models is long and fascinating and is tied to developments in mathematics, signal processing, and digital computers.1 A full exploration of this subject would require a dedicated</p>

<p>book. Nevertheless, I would like to explore a few key concepts in this chapter to encourage fluidity. Directly put, a transient is something ‚Äútemporary, brief, [and] fleeting.‚Äù2 In acoustics, this refers to ‚Äúa sound of very short duration, e.g., the sharp attack (‚Äòonset transient‚Äô) at the beginning of a note or any rapid change in sound level.‚Äù3 More specifically in voice science, transient refers to both uttered sounds with a sudden onset and short duration (for example, the consonants /t/ or /k/) and also the sharp changes in supraglottal pressure associated with the drop in transglottal airflow as the folds come into contact each glottal cycle. The transient theory then concerns the repeated interactions of transglottal airflow patterns and the resulting excitations of the vocal tract. These interactions are typically modeled using a waveform that graphs changes in air pressure over time or a spectrum or spectrogram set to show these glottal excitation patterns. Steady state describes a system in which a pattern of vibrations is assumed to be continuous and periodic; that is to say, perfectly repeating.4 This means that although the complex pressure pattern generated by the repeated excitation of the vocal tract may contain multiple slow and fast oscillations that may or may not mathematically align perfectly with the fundamental, the vocal folds themselves periodically repeat at a meaningfully regular fundamental frequency. This allows one to characterize those faster, within-period oscillations in terms of the repetition of the frequency of that large-scale vocal fold oscillation. For this approach to have meaning, one must simultaneously consider multiple repetitions of the transient excitation of the vocal tract. The steady-state theory therefore concerns the mathematical averaging of multiple glottal cycles at once and is typically modeled using a spectrum or spectrogram set to display harmonics. These two conceptual lenses do not inherently conflict. As Fletcher (1929) writes: The difference in the two theories is not, as some suppose, a difference in the conception of what is going on while the vowel sounds are being produced, but in the method of representing or</p>

<p>describing the motions in definite physical terms. The . . . [transient] point of view enables one to visualize in a more direct way what is taking place and consequently is of greater value to the phonetician interested in the mechanism of speech production. It probably enables one better to grasp the fundamental characteristic differences between the vowels. The . . . [steady-state] point of view is probably more useful to the engineer who is interested in designing telephone systems to properly transmit speech. The separation of the speech into its component frequencies makes it possible to see quickly which frequencies must be transmitted by the system to completely carry all the characteristics of speech.5 One of these theories characterizes the cyclical process itself, while the other summarizes the result of that process. In normal voicing, it is the sudden drop in transglottal airflow upon the contacting of the vocal folds that initiates the impulse that excites the air in the vocal tract. The resonant response of the vocal tract dampens in a complex manner over a short amount of time. In these terms, we can understand voicing as the overlapping of the end of each resonant excitation of the vocal tract with the start of the next. Ultimately, it is the repetition of these patterns that creates the radiated pressure wave. The driving forces for this process are complex and feature important nonlinear concepts,6 but this simplification is nevertheless accurate at a model level. Even so, it is also true that if this process is periodic (or in the case of a human voice, quasiperiodic), a Fourier transform is a useful tool for characterizing these repeating patterns. A Fourier transform allows one to average together long durations of time (relative to the timescale of a pitch period), which effectively summarizes key features that are present within the repeated pattern. Both lenses may be used when explaining voice production, but only one of them describes its physical nature. In this chapter we will use the transient model to explore several aspects of timbre and pitch through a waveform. It is my hope that presenting this complementary conceptual model will both further</p>
