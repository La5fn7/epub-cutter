<p>INTRODUCING PITCH, AUDITORY ROUGHNESS, AND TONE COLOR As I wrote above, a Fourier transform mathematically summarizes repeated aspects of an audio waveform and displays it as a spectrum. It does not illustrate the physical nature of voice production. It also does not display how we perceive that sound. With that established, we now confront what a spectrogram or power spectrum leaves out. Pitch , auditory roughness , and tone color characterize much of what is missing. These perceptual qualities will be unpacked individually in chapters 5 through 9. Chapter 10 offers a framework for reading these qualities into a spectrum or spectrogram. In 2017 I proposed a framework for thinking about the objective aspects of timbre relevant to a voice.24 This model explores the voice through the simplified intersection of the three perceptual qualities mentioned above: pitch, auditory roughness, and tone color. More specifically, these terms point to meaningful contrasts along continuums: pitch to noise, pure to buzzy, and the vowel-like qualities between dark and bright. I believe that as a singing voice migrates through pitch, intensity, timbre, and registration options, incredibly powerful aural cues for singers and voice teachers lie at the intersection of these percepts. Indeed, one may perceive the sound of a singer as being composed of multiple, simultaneously sounding, qualitatively separable percepts. The relative presence, absence, strength, and weakness of these qualities can characterize genre, registration, and affect. These qualities are quickly identifiable, easily differentiated, and do not exist prior to the processing of the pressure wave by the cochlea. This means that different sound sources may have timbral qualities in common simply because they stimulate the ear in a similar manner. More on this in chapter 4. This model allows voice teachers and students to begin to assign pedagogically relevant perceptual qualities to the spectrum and spectrogram images they see in their textbooks and journal articles. However, the more meaningful practical application may ultimately lie in</p>

<p>ear training and functional listening. One should be able to predict and discuss the sound (not simply the phoneme) captured in those images with reasonably high accuracy. One should also be able to understand, identify, label, and predict obligate perceptual changes in a voice as the singer changes pitch, intensity, timbre, and registration, and to do so without the help of a computer.</p>
