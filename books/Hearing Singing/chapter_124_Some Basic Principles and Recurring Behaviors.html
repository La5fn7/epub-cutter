<p>SOME BASIC PRINCIPLES AND RECURRING BEHAVIORS Here I have organized a few additional thoughts that do not fit into our broader functional listening narrative. Consider how they might come up in multiple contexts, and generalize across your teaching population: Voice registers only exist when you are singing loud enough. The voice is only broken if you use it in a broken manner. Taking these two ideas together, smooth registration involves playing with loudness (and timbre) to navigate challenging pitch transitions. As you are working to balance the system, the louder you sing, the more unbalanced a challenging range will become. This does not mean you have to sing quietly, just that singing quieter is a useful intermediate step in your training. You can either dump a lot of power into your system or just a little. Both ways sound great, and neither is right. Neither way owns warmth or brightness. You can stimulate a sound that has almost any combination of warmth, brightness, purity, power, buzziness, or noise. When you use more energy, the nonlinear interactions become more powerful. You can depower them by just singing more quietly. Never get with push what you can first get with stretch. This especially applies to high pitch ranges, which benefit from longer vocal folds. Stretch is easier if the larynx is not high in the throat. The best way to guide a singer to dynamically rebalance their registration as they sing is to make sure they care about what they are singing. If you seek to communicate, you will bring nuanced cadence and prosody to the text. By definition, we achieve this by dynamically adjusting loudness and timbre. This justifies why we might practice the text separately from the music and practice the</p>

<p>text on a sustained pitch or with speechlike pitch contours before marrying it to the melody. Language demands ongoing spectro-temporal fluctuations between phonemes. This means that continuous vowels of equal power very quickly stop sounding like language. Enjoy the timbre of the transitions as you move your articulators from sound to sound. Changes in dynamics are changes in timbre. Getting louder means adding brightness and possibly buzziness, even if that means you must slightly open a close or rounded vowel. If you open your vowel on the way up, do not forget to close it again on the way down. There was probably an airflow resistance reason you started more close. Watching just the mouth position of an elite singer may not help you imitate them. An unseen beneficial narrowing further back in the vocal tract may be primarily responsible for the sound you attribute to their mouth shape. Be careful not to mistake a behavior of the voice for the potential of the voice. The perceptual signifiers tied to a specific genre almost certainly call on only a subset of potential vocal functions. There is no technical work outside an understanding of the expressive sound target. We have no idea what we need to work on technically until we know what we need to communicate. The bottom half of the treble staff is the pitch range of maximal timbral flexibility. The way you choose to register this range is a strong indicator of genre. Assuming you have the physical capacity to sing this high, you can sing in this range in many ways and not hurt yourself. Some of the loudest sounds you can make require almost no effort, so long as you exploit the asymmetries of energy transfer in the singing body. Singing is a whole-body act, which means no one part of the body has to do all the work.</p>

<p>Very few sounds that most singers will make require you to first press your vocal folds together uncomfortably. And the sounds that do involve muscular medialization of the vocal folds still tend to balance the tracheal and supraglottal pressures so that the resulting phonation is efficient. Play with the liminal space between how much and how little vocal fold adduction is required for the sound you want to make. If there is a breathy-to-pressed continuum of vocal fold adduction, robust singing is in the middle. A chaotically noisy exercise‚Äîfor example, a lip bubble or a voiced fricative‚Äîmight obscure your ability to hear compromises in vocal function. The study of voice acoustics does not just ask us to understand how to sing high notes loud. It is a way of understanding the interactive nature of the entire singing system, and it should be a tool to explain any sound the voice can make. If your concept of voice acoustics can only accommodate sounds within one genre, you lack a general understanding. Incredibly intense sounds can be made with what still feels like balanced laryngeal effort. Adjacent functions will also have balanced laryngeal effort. It is better to ramp the entire system up or down as a whole than to come off your center. Always understand the functional purpose of an exercise before you give it. Be clear in your mind whether you are stimulating high or low airflow, high or low airflow resistance, deep or shallow vocal fold contact, arytenoid cartilage closure or not. Always know if you are stimulating consequential vocal tract shaping or neutralizing the effect of the vocal tract. You do not need to do more than clarify the resulting pitch, loudness, and timbre for your singer, but you should aim to understand the desired response both declaratively and procedurally.</p>

<p>If you are a classical singer, the thought that you have two defined registers is probably making your chest voice heavy to the top and your headvoice weak at the bottom. Learning to mix and belt helps everything about classical singing. There are very few functions that cannot get louder or quieter or change pitch up or down. Never ascribe inherent limitations to a vocal function.</p>
