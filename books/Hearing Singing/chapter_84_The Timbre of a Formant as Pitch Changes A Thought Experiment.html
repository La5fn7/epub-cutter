<p>THE TIMBRE OF A FORMANT AS PITCH CHANGES: A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT Join me in a thought experiment. I suggest that a pure tone at F7 (~2.8 kHz) has an |~i| tone color. Listen to it in isolation and you will likely notice its brightness. Play it into your mouth with a small speaker (for example, from an iPhone) and you will notice it ‚Äúpops‚Äù into resonance when you shape your vocal tract for [i]. However, by definition, that pure tone has neither auditory roughness nor a pitch-less, unresolved portion of its spectrum. When strong energy around 2.8 kHz exists in a spectrum, we must consider the intersection of that tone color with the auditory roughness and pitch resolution of the formant it is part of. Figure 10.1 illustrates this. All four images represent sounds with very similar tone colors in the peak centered on F7 (~2.8 kHz) but with differing degrees of auditory roughness and pitch resolution. You can clearly visualize that spectral component in all four waveforms.</p>

<p>Figure 10.1 Four images (a‚Äìd) showing waveforms (left) and spectra (right) that all have a strong peak centered on ~2.8 kHz. (a) shows a pure tone at 2.8 kHz. (b) shows a peak at ~2.8 kHz on the third harmonic (3f o). (c) shows a peak at ~2.8 kHz on the sixth harmonic (6f o). (d) shows a peak at ~2.8 kHz on the twelvth harmonic (12f o) which is unresolved and very rough (buzzy). Source: Synthesized by author in Madde.</p>

<p>Figure 10.1 (a) shows a sine tone where the frequency has an |~i| tone color. We already know that this sample would elicit no auditory roughness because it is &lt; 5f o, and there is no noisy, pitch-lessness because it is 1f o. It is also below the 5 kHz threshold, but all these samples are. Figure 10.1 (b) shows a peak at ~2.8 kHz centered on what would be the third harmonic (3f o) of a periodic tone with a fundamental equivalent to ~933 Hz (around B ‚ô≠ 5). In this sample, the strong |~i| quality elicits no auditory roughness because it is &lt; 5f o and resolves into the pitch because it is &lt; 9f o. Figure 10.1 (c) shows a peak at ~2.8 kHz centered on what would be the sixth harmonic (6f o) of a periodic tone with a fundamental equivalent to ~466 Hz (around B ‚ô≠ 4). In this sample the strong |~i| quality is resolved into the pitch because it is &lt; 9f o and rough (buzzy) because it is &gt; 5f o. Figure 10.1 (d) shows a peak at ~2.8 kHz centered on what would be the twelfth harmonic (12f o) of a periodic tone with a fundamental equivalent to ~233 Hz (around B ‚ô≠ 3). In this sample the strong |~i| quality is unresolved from the pitch (noisy) because it is &gt; 8f o and very rough (buzzy) because it is well above 5f o. Note that in samples (b) through (d), I included equal intensity harmonic energy on either side of the target frequency of 2.8 kHz. I also filled in the lower harmonics of whatever harmonic series fit. For example, this is what I meant by suggesting that in (b), ~2.8 kHz would be 3f o of a fundamental at B ‚ô≠ 5. It is worth thinking through why I made these choices. Remember that harmonics are a way to characterize faster moving aspects of a periodically repeating pattern. This pattern is characterized by the faster pressure patterns of the vocal tract resonances that repeat within the slower pressure change of the fundamental. Without those additional harmonics in the synthesized sound, there would be no periodic repetition of that slower pattern, and these formant peaks would elicit no qualities of roughness or pitch resolution. In all three cases, there is a fast ripple at ~2.8 kHz that rides along a slower pulse at the frequency equivalent to the pitch percept. If you would like to explore this or generate your own custom files, see Lab #20.</p>

<p>Those samples clearly sound synthesized. So what does this sound like in a real human? Fortunately, many singing voices have a spectral peak in the range of ~2.8 kHz (around an |~i| tone color). It does not matter whether you have a sample that precisely centers on that frequency or not, as |~i| covers a wide frequency range. By recording a range of pitches and pass-filtering a region surrounding the center frequency of the nearest peak, you will hear that the tone color of the sample remains similar even as the pitch resolution and auditory roughness changes. This will be true regardless of the vowel you choose, although note that vowels like [u] and [o] tend not to concentrate much energy in that higher |~i| range. Sing a glide from high to low and you will hear auditory roughness and pitch-lessness emerge in the pass-filtered frequency band as 1f o falls, while the tone color remains similar (see figure 10.2 for an example of this). See Lab #21.</p>

<p>Figure 10.2 (Top) spectrogram and (bottom) waveform of a scale from 1f o = ~2.8 kHz to ~12 Hz, pass filtered between 2 kHz and 3.7 kHz with a 100 Hz smoothing. Source: Synthesized by the author in Madde. Additionally, the timbre of a complex tone tends to be temporally variable; it varies over time. The changes undergone by a pure tone are limited to amplitude or frequency. A complex tone may independently vary the presence of energy at multiple frequencies in the spectrum, and we know that the ear responds differently to these different portions of the spectrum. To return to figure 7.9 from chapter 7, a sung decrescendo tends to remove higher frequency energy from the spectrum quicker than it removes lower frequency energy. Those high-frequency and low- frequency regions of the spectrum may elicit different amounts of auditory roughness and pitch resolution, but they also trigger contrasting tone colors. They literally sound different from one another. The percepts of such sounds are formed not just at the intersections of these multiple timbral qualities but also in the way or ways they change over time.</p>
