<p>THE TIMING OF TIMBRE We have set the groundwork for an interesting way to understand the separability of pitch and timbre in the human voice. We know that the pitch percept is generated when a periodic pressure pattern repeatedly stimulates the ear. We also know that these patterns themselves contain even faster oscillations that define important aspects of the timbre. Some of these aspects of timbre need to unfold over a certain amount of time. For example, let us consider an [u] vowel characterized by a strong first resonance (f R1) around 324 Hz (~E4).7 As one attempts to sing pitches higher than E4 with this vocal tract shape, the vocal folds oscillate increasingly faster than the timbre of that resonance. Or, framed in the time domain, each cycle of the 324 Hz resonance takes 3.09 ms to unfold. Any pitch period shorter than this will interrupt the oscillation of these resonances, attenuating their timbral contribution. This suggests that we may better understand the nature of vocal tract resonances if we think of them as fast or slow oscillations, rather than as high or low ones. The subsequent contacting event of the vocal folds per glottal cycle defines the duration of each period, and each resulting impulse interferes with the vocal tract‚Äôs resonant response to the previous one. This means that pitch informs which timbres are available. This suggests that the potential timbre for any pitch technically exists within the impulse and resonant response of a single glottal cycle. It is the duration of the pattern itself that determines how far through the resonant response of the vocal tract the pitch period progresses. If I can essentialize the above, the most obvious implication of this way of viewing voice production is that the repetition of the glottal impulse may disallow the existence of any color or timbre lower in frequency (slower oscillations with a longer period) than the fundamental. Despite the start of each period theoretically contributing a broadband impulse, a resonance with a waveform longer than 1f o does not have time to unfold. Put another way, some aspects of timbre have duration; they must develop‚Äîor not‚Äîwithin a single pitch period. At least within normal</p>

<p>periodic phonation, if that duration is not met, they functionally do not exist. This may seem like a thought experiment rather than actionable information. However, it does begin to explain why timbre appears to migrate as pitch rises, regardless of whether one modifies the shape of the vocal tract. The more the increasingly shorter pitch period affects the unfolding pressure patterns in the vocal tract, the more pronounced this timbral migration. It is possible to sing pitches high enough that the resonant response of the vocal tract is interrupted nearly immediately, even before the initial amplitude of the impulse significantly decreases. This phenomenon not only has a precedent in historical vocal pedagogies8 but also forms the basis of vowel migration within Bozeman‚Äôs framework of acoustic registers.9 This may be challenging to conceptualize on a first pass, so we may benefit from an example. Figure 6.2 (top) shows the impulse and decay response pattern from figure 6.1 superimposed upon itself several times with a delay of about 7.5 ms (1,000 / 7.5 ms = ~133 Hz). Note that adding these pressure waves together yields a periodic pattern that looks credibly human (figure 6.2, bottom). Each ‚Äúnew‚Äù period combines with the end of the previous period. If the two periods are either both positive or both negative at any given moment, the overall amplitude increases. If they differ (for example, one positive and the other negative), they diminish the amplitude. In this example the overlapping ripples align well, boosting the amplitude.</p>

<p>Figure 6.2 (Top) the impulse and decay tail from Figure 6.1 superimposed on itself four more times (dotted gray, dashed gray, solid gray, solid black, dashed-dotted black) with a 7.5 ms delay (~133 Hz, C3) as though the next vocal tract response interrupts and interferes with the decay tail of the previous vocal tract response. Adding these waves (bottom) generates a composite waveform that looks similar to a human voice. Source: Recorded and synthesized by author under controlled conditions. Consider that the pattern in figure 6.2 (bottom) appears to preserve a meaningful amount of the decaying resonance of the vocal tract. The resonant frequencies captured within each period have time to oscillate</p>

<p>five times before their interruption by the next glottal impulse. Figure 6.3 illustrates the much higher pitch A6 (~1.71 kHz with a period of 0.58 ms) sung by a cisgender female soprano. Note the lack of much complexity within the pitch period save for a slight skew left per period. The resulting spectrum has a prominent 1f o and a steep roll-off in the intensity of higher harmonics (see figure 6.3). Figure 6.3 Four periods of the waveform (left) and spectrum (right) of a cisgender female soprano singing the pitch A6 (~1.71 kHz with a period of 0.53 ms). Approximate start of each period marked with a dashed gray line. Recorded by author under controlled conditions. I propose a thought experiment. Consider that the pressure wave radiated by the soprano in figure 6.3 is simpler than the pattern in figure 6.2. The lower pitch allows multiple wide swings in pressure of that baritone‚Äôs vocal tract resonances per period, while the soprano‚Äôs waveform only contains one. Why is this? Does this soprano‚Äôs vocal tract allow for fewer resonances than that baritone‚Äôs does? The same soprano singing a C5 (~523 Hz) [a] (see figure 6.4) reveals a complex waveform and full spectrum, as one would expect from any singer.</p>

<p>Figure 6.4 Four periods of a waveform (left) and spectrum (right) of a cisgender female soprano singing a C5 (~523 Hz with a 1.98 ms period) [a]. Approximate start of each period marked with a dashed gray line. Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. What is the primary difference between these two pressure waves? It is the duration of each period. At a very high pitch, the vocal tract does not have time to resonate the way it does at a lower pitch. This is because resonances take time; they have a minimum duration as they move from low pressure through atmospheric to high pressure, and back through atmospheric to their starting low-pressure value once per cycle. It takes time to complete this cycle, and the speed at which this occurs determines their frequency. The resulting timbres that characterize low sung tones and high sung tones are wildly different because some aspects of timbre must develop over time. In this way, it is correct to assert that timbre has duration. What about larger scale aspects of timbre that only occur when the spectrum fluctuates over time (recall the idea of time-variant aspects of timbre from chapter 4). From our new perspective, we may understand that timbral information is bound up in the pulse of resonances per glottal cycle (the way pressure patterns behave within each pitch period). At the same time, we may understand the way in which that information may change over time‚Äîthe way these patterns vary (even subtly) from pitch period to pitch period. I would like to suggest that the fact that one might parse out this difference at all suggests the value in bringing nuance to the intersection of time and timbre.</p>
