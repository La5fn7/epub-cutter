<p>THE INTERSECTION OF AUDITORY ROUGHNESS, PITCH RESOLUTION, AND TONE COLOR IN A SINGLE FORMANT As explored above, the application of ASTC to complex tones is . . . complex. It must be acknowledged that much of the pressure pattern of a sung sound is not filtered by the ear into the harmonics displayed in a spectrum or spectrogram. Even if harmonics were ‚Äúreal‚Äù and persistent physical phenomena, the critical bands of human hearing suggest that most harmonics could not be heard separately anyway. This means one may not presume that the individual harmonics seen on a spectrogram exist as separate percepts in the way that individually generated pure tones do. Some harmonics absolutely represent persistent oscillations that can be separately perceived. But they are the exceptions. In practice, we should look at the formant structures‚Äînot the harmonics‚Äîin the spectrum to truly grasp what we perceive. Those formant structures will also exhibit additional timbral qualities beyond tone color arising from the nature of their complexity. So how can we talk productively about how tone color intersects the additional timbral qualities of pitch resolution and auditory roughness? Accepting that there is always greater nuance, in simpler terms, pitch resolution and auditory roughness move with the fundamental frequency of vocal fold oscillation. We can imagine tone color as the space they move through. This means that different formants in the spectrum‚Äîeach with its own different and varying degrees of pitch resolution and auditory roughness‚Äîcorrespondingly move through different tone colors as pitch changes. The formants represented by rising and falling harmonics in a spectrum or spectrogram potentially fill in a wide range of possible tone colors. Remember, I am positioning tone color as an effective way to understand the qualitative properties of the frequency domain, independent of a given position within a harmonic series. For example, it would be nonsensical to suggest that 5f o in general has a single, specific,</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 242</h3>

<p>identifiable tone color. It does not. However, 5f o at a specific frequency does. Next, consider the perceptual qualities of auditory roughness. We have learned that this percept is usefully understood through its relationship to the fundamental of a periodic sound. That is to say, for most of the singable pitch range, roughness begins above the fifth harmonic (5f o). In general terms, as the fundamental rises or falls in a pitch space (typically by increasing or decreasing in frequency), roughness tends to track similarly. A more nuanced view would capture that as pitch rises above the treble staff, roughness begins higher in the harmonic series, and as pitch falls below the bass staff, roughness begins lower in the harmonic series.1 With the understanding that the de facto ceiling of 5 kHz (&gt; D‚ôØ8) acts as a sort of aural threshold, pitch similarly merits additional nuance. As a brief aside, the piano‚Äôs highest note is C8, at 4186 Hz; the notes of a piano stop just below that upper pitch percept threshold. The highest notes on a violin (A7) and concert harp (G7 or G#7) are similarly just below that same threshold. This is no coincidence. Why waste building materials generating playable sounds no one would hear as a pitch? Most periodic energy above this 5 kHz threshold tends to not resolve into the pitch, regardless of its location in the harmonic series. But again, for most of the range singable by humans, ordinal position within the harmonic series points to pitch resolution. Again, the simple rule of thumb is that harmonics one (1f o) through eight (8f o) most significantly contribute to the pitch percept, while higher harmonics contribute an increasingly noisy quality.2 You may alternately think in terms of the slower, less rapidly dampened resonances of the vocal tract contributing to the pitch percept, while the quickly attenuated faster resonances sound like buzzy noise instead. Now consider this thought experiment. A singer sings a sound with a strong formant that appears on a spectrogram as the fifth through ninth harmonics (5f o‚Äì9f o). We will assume that this formant is so prominent that it dominates the timbre (see figure 10.3). Crucially, we will also</p>

<p>assume that as 1f o rises and falls, that the peak similarly rises and falls in frequency; it remains perfectly associated with 5f o‚Äì9f o. In the time domain, this would suggest that resonance oscillates increasingly faster as the pitch period shortens. Figure 10.3 Spectrum of a sound with a prominent formant centered on the seventh harmonic (7f o). Source: Synthesized by author in Madde. Based on the rules of pitch and roughness as explained in chapter 7, we would expect this part of the spectrum to be buzzy (&gt; 5f o) and resolved into the pitch (&lt; 9f o). As pitch rises and falls, these percepts follow. However, because this formant is moving higher and lower in frequency as the fundamental moves, the tone color of this portion of the spectrum changes as pitch rises and falls. Consider this portion of the spectrum (5f o‚Äì9f o) in isolation for a moment. When the fundamental is D2, this formant sounds somewhat like an American English [o] (corresponding to the |~o| ASTC of a pure tone at the frequency of D5, or ~587 Hz), because the prominent center of this formant is approximately centered on that frequency. In practical terms,</p>

<p>we do not need to measure the distribution of the frequency energy in this formant to estimate the ASTC. The strong harmonic in the middle is easily seen in the spectrum. Raise the fundamental of this harmonic series while preserving the intensity of each harmonic (the formant also rises), and the color of this peak will perceptually open as though moving through incomplete versions of […î], […ë], [a], [√¶], [e], and finally [i]. If you do this with an awareness of the ASTC labels, you will notice that the tone color changes along that continuum. How ever one labels this phenomenon, it is easy to demonstrate these contrasts along the tone color continuum. The auditory roughness and pitch resolution of this rising formant remain reasonably similar for most of the potential pitch range, eventually turning into buzzy, pitch-less noise. Most voice teachers I have demonstrated this to liken that final sound to the sound of crickets. See Lab #22. Next, imagine that instead of rising with the fundamental, the formant in figure 10.3 instead persists at the same frequency while the pitch rises. In the time domain, this would suggest that the resonance in the vocal tract continues to oscillate at the same frequency regardless of how fast the vocal folds oscillate. Since the frequency of that resonance remains constant, and thus the frequency center of the resulting formant correspondingly remains constant, the tone color does not change much. Instead, when the pitch is low enough, that tone color will sound like buzzy noise. As pitch rises, that tone color will resolve into the pitch. A little higher and that tone color will lose its buzziness. Once the fundamental aligns with the resonance, it will sound substantially like a pure tone. This is the reverse of the process explored in figure 10.2. See Lab #23. Strange things start to happen to the tone color of this formant as 1f o begins to rise close in frequency to the frequency of that resonance. Remember, as a physical oscillation of the air in the vocal tract, the frequency of that resonance points to how quickly it completes one cycle oscillating from low to high and back to low pressure. At the end of each oscillation, that low-pressure front returns to the air mass just above the glottis. When the pitch is low (period is long) relative to the frequency of</p>

<p>the resonance, for example the arrangement shown as a spectrum in figure 10.3, that resonance has already traveled forward and backward in the vocal tract many times. As such, it would be subject to more significant damping, and there may not be much interaction of that resonance and the next supraglottal impulse. If instead that resonance pattern only unfolds three times, that resonance will undergo far less damping. To return to Titze‚Äôs analogy of a child on a swing, if you only push them once every seven swings, their oscillation will have dampened (diminished in amplitude) to the point that your push may apply more force to the swing than their swinging does to your hands. If instead that oscillation only unfolds three times, it will be far less impacted by damping and the average amplitude remains higher. Repeatedly interrupting that oscillation two and a half times through its pattern‚Äîwhen the kid has yet to swing back to you, or the returning low-pressure front has yet to make it back to the vocal folds‚Äîmay noticeably impact the average amplitude of that ongoing oscillation and, by analogy, the amplitude of the radiated sound. If you try to push them halfway through their first swing, you may get hurt. Fortunately, the analogy breaks down for singing here, but the average amplitude of a resonance that oscillates at 1.5f o is similarly weaker. Aligning the supraglottal impulse with the return of that low-pressure front allows the oscillation of the resonance to transfer its motion across glottal cycles, which helps to establish a standing wave in the vocal tract. This allows acoustic energy to accumulate in the vocal tract and helps create the percept that strong aspects of the continuous sound emerge from a discrete, periodic process. In singing, as in pushing a child on a swing, amplitude matters. A mistimed push at the two-and-a-half-swings mark makes a bigger difference the harder you pushed the child the first time. In this way, the acoustical relationships of consequence tend to go away when singing quietly, and these beneficial relationships become consequential when singing loud, high pitches. Back to our thought experiment. As pitch rises closer to the stable formant frequency, consequential mistiming occurs between the end of</p>

<p>the resonance and the next supraglottal impulse. In a spectrum we see these mistimed relationships as harmonics straddling the imagined resonance that is between them. The effect is a weaker, more neutralized sound. In the time domain, the resonance starts every period oscillating at the same frequency that it would if there were a perfect alignment with a later supraglottal impulse. It is just rudely interrupted by the vocal folds at an inopportune time. The spectrum displays this as weaker harmonics to either side because the Fourier transform preferentially represents repeated patterns within the pitch period as harmonics of that fundamental. Thus, as pitch rises and that resonance remains the same, you will start to hear the timbre alternate between a clear vowel sound and a more muted or neutral version of that vowel sound. This typically becomes noticeable when the resonance is between 3f o and 4f o, and even more so when between 2f o and 3f o. The timbral transition from f R1 aligning with 2f o and that resonance sitting between 1f o and 2f o‚Äî meaning it is interrupted by a pressure drop as it is partway through its second pressure cycle‚Äîis so strong that Bozeman calls this transition the ‚Äúpitch of turning.‚Äù3 He further labels the mistimed relationship 1f o &lt; f R1 &lt; 2f o after the historical term voce chiusa (closed voice or close [klo äs] timbre), and the sound prior to that mistiming (2f o &lt; f R1) after the similarly historical term voce aperta (open voice or open timbre).4</p>
