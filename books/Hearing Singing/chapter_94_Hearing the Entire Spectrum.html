<p>period. This appears in the spectrum as the slowest vocal tract resonance aligning with 2f o. Because these two samples are sung at different pitches, the tone colors of those first formant (F 1) peaks are not quite the same. The second harmonic of G4 falls in the |~…î| range, while the second harmonic of C5 falls in the |~…ë| range. Listen to just the first formant (F 1) from these two samples back-to-back and you will note that the tone color opens from the Pasquale to the Merman. Figure 10.9 Waveforms (left) and spectra (right) of G4 (top) sung by Steven Pasquale in ‚ÄúWondering‚Äù from Bridges of Madison County by Jason Robert Brown and of C5 (bottom) sung by Ethel Merman in ‚ÄúEverything‚Äôs Coming up Roses‚Äù from Laurent, Styne, and Sondheim‚Äôs Gypsy.

<p>Now that we have considered various strategies for keeping a strong resonance oscillating within the pitch period and considered what the tone color contribution of the first formant (F 1) is in each case, we will consider the rest of the spectrum. Be prepared to apply your visual annotation skills. Looking back at figure 10.6, we would predict that the soprano (top) would trigger little auditory roughness. She would convey a shimmery, noisy quality in addition to the dominant ASTC of 1f o. All but two of her harmonics shown here fall within the |~i| or |bright ~i| tone color ranges. Her top four harmonics fall above the 5 kHz pitch perception threshold. She would have a fundamentally uncomplicated timbre characterized by the fundamental and the bright and buzzy ‚Äúrest of the spectrum,‚Äù which you may recall we characterized earlier as sounding like crickets. The countertenor, by contrast, has a lot of energy in very bright, rough, and noisy spectral regions. His timbre would feature a strong |~u| from the fundamental, and at least two qualities that sound like darker and brighter versions of |~i|. Or more likely, those qualities blend into a wash of |~i|. His second formant (F 2) is buzzy, and the next formant above that may not resolve into the pitch. Additionally, there is some higher frequency noise in the spectrum, although it is of very low intensity. Looking back at figure 10.8, let us compare Bareilles (top) to Corelli (middle). Again, I acknowledge that the recording process has certainly reshaped the high-frequency parts of the spectrum here. But notice the difference in harmonics over 5 kHz, and that the energy clustered around 3 kHz in Corelli‚Äôs example is more broadly spread between about 2.4 kHz and 5 kHz in Bareilles‚Äôs. Comparing these two recordings, we can note that Bareilles has much more noisy brightness than Corelli does in this example and more roughness across a wider range of |~i| tone colors. Corelli‚Äôs voice will likely sound very powerful, but in a more timbrally compact manner. Thomas Hampson‚Äôs spectrum (figure 10.8, bottom) looks remarkably similar to Corelli‚Äôs, as though the entire formant structure were transposed down a fourth. Because those formants slowed down for Hampson, the tone color changes.</p>

<p>Looking back at figure 10.9, I am struck by the delightful similarities between Pasquale (top) and Merman (bottom). As with Hampson compared to Corelli, Pasquale has transposed the formant structure down a fourth compared to Merman. With the exception of additional noisy high-frequency harmonics in this recording, Merman, Hampson, Corelli, and Pasquale all have managed their singer‚Äôs formant portion of the spectrum in a similar manner. Unlike Bareilles, who leverages noisy brightness across a wide frequency range, most of the bright energy of the other subjects concentrates between 2.4 kHz and 3 kHz. I will unpack some of the implications of the above in the next chapter, but I would like to make one observation now. In every one of the above examples, regardless of genre or pitch range, these singers manage to sing in a way that keeps a high-amplitude oscillation going in their vocal tract. Because the vocal tract is a more favorable resonator to lower frequency resonances, each of these singers has leveraged a resonance that aligns with the next supraglottal impulse after only one, two, or three oscillations. Much faster resonances are also excited and decay per pitch period; indeed, bright sounds with an |~i| tone color or brighter are a strong feature of every one of these samples except the soprano singing a C6. However, those faster resonances are clearly lower in amplitude in the waveforms. In a physical sense, the slower resonances are significantly stronger oscillations. Once again, we return to one of the many paradoxes of understanding both how we produce and how we perceive voices. The ear is more sensitive to pressure oscillations between about 1 kHz and 3.5 kHz than slower or faster oscillations. This means that we may hear the bright part of the sound as louder, even though the warm part of the sound is helping drive phonation. This is especially confounding at a distance, when the ear becomes even less sensitive to lower and higher frequency stimuli, selectively preferring the midrange. So while it is true that many ways of singing favor a strong, bright |~i| quality, setting that brightness as the initial training target may cause the warmer parts of the spectrum to suffer. It is those harder to hear, warmer percepts that the singer needs to sort out first to secure their technique, because they literally signify that</p>

<p>the system is working efficiently. Put another way, I would much rather start with a singer who has stabilized their voice in a way that would welcome introducing brightness to the existing warmth than try to undo the effort required for a bright sound generated by an excess of tracheal pressure and physical effort.</p>
