<p>THE PITCH EXCEPTION OF OVERTONE SINGING Pitch perception is delightfully complex. The remainder of this chapter will use a time-and-pressure-based model to discuss notable exceptions to the framework that was covered in chapter 5. I argue here that some observable phenomena related to pitch are best conceptualized through their time and pressure characteristics. Let us begin with overtone singing. Here this term points to the generation of a pure overtone in the context of otherwise periodic phonation. Other, often noisier approaches to overtone singing exist that leverage the same basic premise. We know that in periodic phonation in a speech-pitch range (see figure 6.5), we tend to see a drop in pressure at what we define as the beginning of each pitch period, and a drop in the amplitude of the waveform throughout the period. Imagine again giving a child a single push on a swing (and, to be sure, this waveform traces a complex swinging motion). The amplitude of their oscillation decreases in distance from the midline over time. Figure 6.5 Two periods of a waveform of cisgender man singing […ë] at pitch D ‚ô≠ 3 (~135 Hz, 7.4 ms).

<p>midline (atmospheric pressure). Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. Thinking back to the physiological process of auditory transduction covered in chapter 3, imagine the pressure wave in the air setting in motion the tympanic membrane, the ossicles, and ultimately the final ossicle: the pistonlike stapes. The stapes instigates the wave that ripples through the fluid-filled cochlea, which sets in motion the frequency- filtering process of the inner ear. The start of each period introduces a strong pull/push force on the stapes which in turn transfers that motion to the cochlea. This may bring some nuance to what we see in an audio waveform: Peaks (excursions above the midline) represent ‚Äúpushes‚Äù on the tympanic membrane and stapes, while troughs (excursions below the midline) represent ‚Äúpulls.‚Äù Subsequent pulls and pushes within each period diminish in amplitude. This sets up a regular pattern of transients per period in figure 6.5 that comports with pitch perception according to the timing theory. Compare this with figure 6.6, which shows a cisgender woman executing a D ‚ô≠ 4 with a pronounced overtone at 5f o. This pressure wave sets up a slow repeating pattern (once per period, marked with a dashed gray line) of transients giving rise to the pitch percept of D ‚ô≠ 4. Note the faster ripple within those periods. Straightforward math tells us that this faster pattern has a frequency five times that of the slower pattern. Note too that the amplitude of this faster oscillation does not significantly decrease over the entire period. This is certainly unlike what we observe in figure 6.5.</p>

Note that the overall deviations in amplitude from the midline remain high throughout the entire pitch period of D ‚ô≠ 4. Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. Consider for a moment what this pressure wave looks like as the stapes pushes into the fluid of the cochlea. Its complex, pistonlike motion traces two patterns at once (see figure 6.7). The gray waveform outlines the slower pattern, corresponding to the first and second harmonic (1f o and 2f o) in the spectrum. That pattern repeats once every 3.6 ms (D ‚ô≠ 4, ~278 Hz). The black waveform outlines the continuous fifth harmonic (5f o) in the spectrum, a sinusoidal motion repeating every 0.7 ms (~1.39 kHz).</p>

Now imagine the motion of the stapes as it traces this pattern forward and backward. The faster pattern regularly pushes and pulls on the stapes while that bone simultaneously moves in and out at the speed of the slower pattern. Add the amplitudes of the two waveforms in figure 6.7 together (allow them to constructively interfere), and the result is an approximation of the image shown in figure 6.6. Despite moving in and out slowly, the stapes also traces out the faster pattern as though it were an additional fundamental. This leads to an intriguing explanation of overtone singing. The successful vocal tract posture for overtone singing needs to tune a resonance to an integer multiple of the pitch frequency; but it must also be shaped in a way that prevents that energy from significantly dropping in amplitude over the course of the period. This is achieved by decreasing the damping of the vocal tract for the resonance in question. In doing so, the oscillation continues to the end of the period. In a spectrum, this would appear as a strong harmonic. In my experience, singers tend to achieve this resonance adjustment at least in part by firming the tissue of the tongue. If this is so, it suggests the corollary that non-overtone</p>

<p>singing produces a more contiguous and gradual spectrum when no single resonance completely dominates the entire pitch period. Strictly speaking, overtone singers do not amplify a higher harmonic of the fundamental. Instead, they excite a resonance of the vocal tract such that it (1) receives a well-timed boost by each supraglottal impulse, and (2) never significantly decreases in amplitude (dampens). The only frequencies that meet both of these physical requirements are integer multiples (harmonic frequencies) of the fundamental frequency. Therefore, strong overtones always fall into the harmonic series, even though they are products of the vocal tract. The result of this process can be understood in this way: The radiated pressure wave creates two separate, simultaneous pitch percepts in the mind of a listener. One is a complex wave at the fundamental frequency of supraglottal impulses; the other is a pure and continuously oscillating higher resonance at a harmonic frequency of that fundamental. If perception dictates what sounds the human voice is capable of making (recall our question at the end chapter 3 that cut to the heart of what it is to train a singer), overtone singing is an example of a non-dysphonic voice producing two pitch percepts at once. If you can overtone sing, explore this idea experientially in Lab #7.</p>
