<p>WHAT IS FORMANT TUNING? Formant tuning typically refers to the beneficial alignment of a given vocal tract resonance with a voice source harmonic to generate a pronounced peak in the spectrum, a formant. This is usually one of the two slowest vocal tract resonances (f R1 or f R2) with a lower harmonic (most often between 1f o and 4f o). The concept of formant tuning may have been most explicitly framed in this way by Donald Miller (2006),10 but it also appears conceptually in the work of Berton Coffin (2002) 11 and Kenneth Bozeman (2013)12 and is similarly described by Titze (2000).13 According to the source-filter model, one might imagine the interaction of a discrete harmonic‚Äîpresumably generated by the vocal folds‚Äîand a discrete resonance of the vocal tract. It is interesting to reconsider this framing if harmonics are more of a mathematical summary of the repeated excitation of the vocal tract than physical phenomena emanating from the vocal folds. Up to this point, I have not made a meaningful distinction between the terms formant and resonance. What these words point to in a physical sense depends on the model being used to explore voice production. Within the source-filter model, one frequently differentiates a resonance from a formant in the following terms: A resonance is a potential amplifying power of the vocal tract, while a formant is the realized spectral peak once that resonance amplifies a vocal fold source harmonic.14 Within this model, that distinction makes a good deal of sense. In the context of the transient theory model, I have been using the term resonance in a slightly different manner. Resonance in this case refers to the way in which a mass (in this case, the air in the vocal tract) continues to oscillate on its own once excited by an outside force. While one could certainly consider the potential oscillatory behavior of that air mass, we do not need to separately label that idea within the transient theory. Some may take issue with this framing; others may insist that the</p>

<p>term formant better captures this idea. Whatever label you prefer, just know which physical aspect of voice production this term points to here. Thinking of this behavior of the singing voice in the time-and-pressure domain, we return to the question of how much the resonant response of the vocal tract has dampened prior to the next supraglottal impulse. Remember, if the energy in the vocal tract is still oscillating at high amplitudes above the vocal folds when the next vocal fold contacting occurs, that carried-over energy may either productively facilitate or destructively interfere with the drop in supraglottal pressure brought on by the contacting of the vocal folds. This means that what one observes as formant tuning in a spectrum is unlikely to be the alignment of a discrete harmonic with a resonance in a physical sense. Instead, formant tuning may be more deeply understood as the alignment of one of the many repeating pressure drops of a resonance of the vocal tract with a subsequent supraglottal impulse. This can only occur when the frequency of the vocal tract resonance is at or near an integer multiple of 1f o. In these terms, formant tuning may be more accurately labeled resonance tuning. This is true if (in terms of the steady-state model), the relationship is 1f o aligned with f R1 (Bozeman‚Äôs whoop 15 or D. Miller‚Äôs hoot 16 ), 2f o aligned with f R1 (Bozeman or D. Miller‚Äôs yell 17 ), or 3f o or 4f o aligned with f R2 (D. Miller‚Äôs second formant tuning strategy).18 The fundamental (1f o) aligned with f R1 describes the alignment in time of the vocal fold contacting events with the end of the first oscillation of the slowest vocal tract resonance. This would be like pushing the child on a swing and giving the second push the first time they swing back to you.19 The second harmonic (2f o) aligned with f R1 allows the slowest vocal tract resonance to oscillate two complete times before the vocal folds contact. In our swing analogy, we would let the child return to us a second time before the next push. Notably, the oscillation of the vocal tract air mass and the arc of the swinging child both diminish in amplitude as twice as much time passes before they are once again set in motion. Donald Miller‚Äôs second formant tuning strategy has no correlate in this analogy (the swing only has one dominant resonance), but the vocal tract tuned</p>

<p>for this resonance strategy simply leverages the oscillation of the next fastest resonance while quickly damping the slowest resonance (f R1). In this way, the vocal folds oscillate at a subharmonic of the oscillating resonance. This model explains two observable phenomena related to formant tuning. First, there appear to be no consequential effects of formant tuning when singing low pitches.20 That is to say, although a spectrum may display the alignment of f R1 and 8f o at a low pitch (for example), the amplitude of the pressure oscillations (resonances) in the vocal tract will have dropped dramatically, to the point that the effect on the next supraglottal impulse is questionable. The response of the vocal tract has died down because the pitch period is so long. Second, successful formant tuning likely does not solely impact the harmonic frequency in question. The ongoing resonance in the vocal tract as the folds contact likely affects the speed and strength of the supraglottal impulse generated with each vocal fold contacting event. This impacts the entire source impulse in a nonlinear fashion, contributing energy across the entire spectrum. For example, the strong second harmonic (2f o) commonly observed in many approaches to belting21 likely points to a physical oscillation in the supraglottal air mass that may help to generate much faster aspects of the spectrum. Why must formant tuning occur at whole-number multiples of the frequency of vocal fold oscillation? Because those are the resonant frequencies that best align drops in the pressure of the resonance with the subsequent supraglottal impulses. If the hypothetical frequency of our slowest resonance (f R1) is three times faster than the frequency of vocal fold oscillation (3f o), every third oscillation of the resonance will assist the periodic drop in supraglottal pressure. This will be true even if that resonance is a part of the complex oscillating pattern within the vocal tract that also features other rates of pressure oscillation. If our f R1 is 2.5f o‚Äîimagine the second and third harmonics straddling the resonance in a spectrum‚Äîphonation continues reasonably unaffected. The resonance is excited at the start of each period, but its misalignment with</p>

<p>each subsequent glottal closing diminishes that energy by the end of each period. Three possible outcomes emerge: (1) The result will be less- efficient phonation as the supraglottal air mass no longer receives the acoustic boost of a resonance that aligns with each glottal contacting event; (2) the overall amplitude of the signal may decrease; or (3) the timbre may neutralize as the strong contribution of the tone colors of energy at 2f o or 3f o is reduced.22 Returning to the model of pushing a child on a swing, we can slightly misalign our pushing effort without completely arresting (damping) the swinging motion. Conceptually, strategies for f R2 tuning account for this kind of misalignment of f R1 by tuning the drop in pressure of an even faster resonance to another multiple of the frequency of supraglottal impulses.23 Efficient phonation seems to be agnostic to which resonance best aligns with the glottal impulse, so long as sufficient acoustic energy exists in the vocal tract. Imagine this phenomenon as a resonance that oscillates over time rather than as the amplification of a persistent harmonic. This allows one to appreciate why formant tuning appears important at times but irrelevant at other times.</p>
