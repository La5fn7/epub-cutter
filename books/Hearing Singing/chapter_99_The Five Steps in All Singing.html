<p>THE FIVE STEPS IN ALL SINGING I would like to explore how one can structure their thinking while training their voice. This framework came from my teacher, Lynne Vardaman, a student of Dan Merriman and Cornelius Reid in New York City. She taught me that as problematic as overthinking can be for a singer, the answer is not to ‚Äúavoid‚Äù thinking, or ‚Äúignore‚Äù those thoughts. Her answer was to think specific thoughts at specific times in the process of singing. The mind does not wander when you give it something to do. What is the thought process of singing? Vardaman suggested breaking singing down into discrete steps that take place in repeating a sequence. These steps are mutually exclusive, which is to say that you cannot go back to a previous step and correct what you just did. Executing Step 1 effectively leaves your body and mind in exactly the right place to begin Step 2. Step 2 similarly hands off to Step 3 with no intermediate thought or action. This continues, and the last step connects to the first step of the next cycle. These steps are not just conceptual, they are actual words that you think. When you give your mind something specific to think, and you keep that thought simple, you may be surprised how quickly an ‚Äúoverthinker‚Äù can directly elicit the desired response and how quickly a ‚Äúnon-thinker‚Äù can deepen their process. These steps are (1) release, (2) clarify, (3) engage, (4) continue, and (5) release. Before I explain each step, please keep in mind that this is one way to organize thoughts as a part of training. Once the response of the body is a direct result of the stimulus, the thinking becomes even simpler. Eventually you just think the thought you want to express, and your body will organize to accomplish that. Think of this as a pedagogically effective crutch to use for a short</p>

<p>time so that it becomes possible for you to directly interface with your student‚Äôs process. Release refers to how you breathe in. I will go into more detail about breathing later in this chapter, but I do not advocate any dogmas related to respiration. For now, imagine that actively thinking the word release encourages several general responses in the body. First, you do not engage any thoracic muscles you would then need to release to continue inhaling to whatever your target is. This is a somewhat common response pattern in uncoordinated singers. It especially reveals itself in a rigid abdominal wall that paradoxically engages and releases in an alternating pattern during the inhalation. Similarly, some singers will attempt to use only muscular effort to suspend or expand the rib cage at the beginning of the inhalation rather than allowing its expansion in response to the displacement of air within the lungs. This typically stiffens the rib cage and inhibits its free reaction to the activity of the rest of the thorax. Different ways of breathing facilitate different ways of singing. How ever you inhale, inhale directly. The first step is to ensure that you do not meet that inhalation with restriction or effort. Hence, think ‚Äúrelease.‚Äù Clarify suggests that you need to imagine what you are going to sing. This idea comes up in various ways in many different approaches to voice teaching. The core concept is that you must stimulate your body with the thought of the exact sound you want to make for your body to make that sound. Once the basic mechanics of a released inhalation have been established, one may immediately think this clarifying stimulus from the start. To be clear, I am not suggesting that you think about how to physically make the sound. Imagine the sound itself. You cannot start singing first and then figure out what you meant to say once the body has been organized. The mental stimulus to make the sound organizes the body.</p>

<p>At first this practice likely needs to be as simple as thinking the vowel sound of an exercise or vocalise. As you move from those simpler thoughts to tackling repertory, you establish a pattern of always thinking the next thing you are going to sing. In this way, the activity of singing is actually your thoughts just before your body sings those sounds. Eventually you will notice that the actual singing always drags just a fraction of a second behind your clarifying thoughts. Or, put another way, your intention to communicate is always just a fraction of a second ahead of your body‚Äôs response. Your thoughts are about the future, and you never make a sound you didn‚Äôt intend to make. This is a great step to slot in musical, expressive, or otherwise affective thoughts, and it takes place either during or simultaneous with the release stimulus. Engage points to an obvious idea, but one that is worth saying out loud. When you breathe in, you are not exhaling. I know. . . that sounds foolish. But think about this as an example of the mutual exclusion of all these steps. Once you have started singing, you cannot go back and think about the sound you wanted to stimulate, nor can you go back and change the way you breathed in. Engage, then, is the moment you start to make the sound. Consider staring at your fingers and thinking ‚Äúmove,‚Äù but not actually commanding the motor task. Thinking the thought and commanding the task at the same time is a different procedural dynamic in the mind and body that we can all notice. This captures the essence of ‚Äúengage.‚Äù It is the doing of the clarified thought. You might also think ‚Äúgo,‚Äù or, in the case of an exercise or vocalise, think of the vowel itself as a verb. Vowels are something you do, not abstract ideas. Shortly after thinking engage, you must think continue. This is the practice of continuing to stimulate the clarified sound while singing. If you take a singer through an exercise on an [a] and notice that vowel shifts to a neutralized sound almost immediately, they are not thinking ‚Äúcontinue.‚Äù Choral directors will say things like,</p>

<p>‚Äúrefresh the vowel‚Äù to remind their singers to remember what they are doing. Your mind must keep stimulating the idea of the sound you want to make. For a while, this part may feel ridiculous. Years ago, a student of mine described his breakthrough in understanding the step by saying, ‚ÄúOh . . . I have to think [a] [a] [a] [a] [a] [a] [a] [a] [a] [a], etc., as I sing this exercise.‚Äù Your body‚Äôs response will not continue to fall in line with your goals if you stop telling your body what to do. Conversely, you may find that many issues clear up quickly once you habituate the process of planning what you mean to do. The final step is to release again, which becomes the start of the next phrase. In this way, a three-minute song is not three minutes long. It is a series of phrases likely no longer than eight to ten seconds each, at most. Every release is a complete reset of your body. What came before is irrelevant to what is about to happen. If you dependably sound worse the longer you sing, target this step. Once you habituate this process, it is easy to observe where a singer goes off the rails. I swear, based on the sounds many singers in training make, that their clarified thought is ‚Äúplease don‚Äôt mess up; please don‚Äôt mess up.‚Äù Singing from a place of panic or fear will not work, as you cannot correct issues after they have already arisen. This five-step process may ultimately have a calming effect on the singer as it significantly reduces their cognitive load.</p>
