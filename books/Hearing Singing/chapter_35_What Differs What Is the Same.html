<p>WHAT DIFFERS? WHAT IS THE SAME? What remains when pitch and loudness are controlled? It is not enough to label that which remains the timbre of a specific instrument, such as a soprano or violin. Or at least we must recognize that each of those instruments has a wide timbral palette. The ANSI definition leaves space to consider that changes in pitch and loudness impact the timbre of that soprano or that violin. As Kai Siedenburg and Stephen McAdams (2017) put it, ‚ÄúThere does not exist the bassoon timbre, but rather a bassoon timbre at a given pitch and dynamic.‚Äù5 Put another way, we anticipate that the timbre of that singer or instrument will change as their pitch and loudness change. Complicating this further, the ANSI definition of timbre centers the difference between two hypothetical sounds. Pitch and loudness are identified as loci of potential similarity. Given the same pitch and loudness, what remains is timbre. Interesting questions arise if we turn the definition around to ask whether there are other similar qualities between otherwise differently timbred sounds. This is an attractive question in a voice pedagogy context. For example, if a study claims that a classical soprano may benefit from aligning their lowest vocal tract resonance with their fundamental starting at D5, the teacher who can hear the effect of that adjustment across their entire population of differently timbred sopranos is advantaged. This remains true whether the teacher chooses to guide their singer toward or away from that acoustical alignment based on their aesthetic targets. If the strong fundamental at that pitch creates a consistent percept in a listener‚Äôs ear‚Äîwhich is to say that one can learn to dependably hear it‚Äî this idea leaves the world of the subjective (or academic) and enters the world of the practical. This is easy to explore with an experiment. Record a singer executing an arpeggio at a moderate tempo starting on the pitch G4 (see figure 4.1). Next, record a violin (or another treble instrument) executing the same passage. Ideally have the instruments match vibrato and intensity‚Äî</p>

<p>the underlying concept is more clearly illustrated the more similar the samples‚Äîbut this is not strictly necessary. Take each sample, the voice and the instrument, and pass-filter the fundamental using a spectrograph like VoceVista Video Pro, Praat, or a similar program. This means you only let that part of the spectrum play back. Play the resulting simple sounds back-to-back and consider what they share in common. What is similar? See Lab #2. Figure 4.1 G major arpeggio. Source: Created by author. First, let us focus on a property of these sounds that Wayne Slawson (1985) suggests might be termed sound color: an inherent, qualitative aspect of a sound unaffected by how that sound evolves over time.6 Or consider how Reinier Plomp (1966) states that ‚Äúin addition to pitch, simple tones have timbre . . . that have some resemblance, depending upon frequency, with particular speech vowels . . . [and] that only on the basis of this assumption the timbre of complex tones can be understood.‚Äù7 Sit with this idea for a moment. By pass-filtering the fundamental from two separate sound sources, we have compared separately produced simple tones of similar frequencies. According to Plomp, the timbre of these tones will vary with frequency. If the frequencies of the two samples are the same, the tone colors will be the same. Put more directly, changing the frequency changes the tone color regardless of the source. Listen to the two samples back-to-back again. Notice that as pitch rises and falls in both the voice and treble instrument, the tone color changes respectively. In anthropomorphized terms, one might perceive that, in a manner consistent with an important aspect of the continuous change from [u] to […î] on a sustained pitch, the</p>

<p>vowel-like color opens as pitch rises. One might suggest that these tone color changes are vowel-like. A non-anthropomorphized view might suggest that human vowels are tone color‚Äìlike. This assertion suggests that speech leverages a set of deeper tone-color percepts. Figure 4.2 sequences this logical process.</p>

<p>Figure 4.2 A logical flowchart illustrating similarities between different sound sources that are currently precluded by the official ANSI definition of timbre. Two important insights flow from this demonstration. The first is that pitch and timbre appear to have a tighter relationship than the ANSI definition of timbre would suggest. Controlling for pitch constrains and informs the possible resulting timbre. The second, implicit in Plomp‚Äôs observation, is that the tone color of that pass-filtered fundamental may be understood as one contributor to the timbre of the complete sound. This too is easily demonstrated experientially. Return to the original recordings of the voice and treble instrument. Prime the listener by first playing the pass-filtered sample followed by playing the full spectrum. If using the filtering feature of VoceVista Video Pro, fade in the rest of the spectrum while the sample loops playback. If using Praat, listen to the isolated fundamental in a Spectrum object and then listen to the entire spectrum. Observe that the tone color contribution of the fundamental is likely persistent in the context of the remainder of the spectrum. See Lab #3. For many, this may be the first practical step in the acquisition of functional listening skills. The tone color aspects of the timbral percept associated with the fundamental displayed on the spectrum or spectrogram is both similar between the voice and the instrument and also noticeably different from the rest of each spectrum. Comparing and contrasting the timbre of the voice and instrument illuminates not just how they differ but also that which they have in common. Now, a leap: If you learn the functional coordination that is associated with the percept of that fundamental‚Äîwhich, I will argue much later in this book, relates to the transglottal airflow volume‚Äîyou can literally hear the function in a singer. The voice teacher who is trained to hear these qualities objectively may not just link what a spectrogram shows onscreen to aspects of a singer‚Äôs sound. They may quickly learn to identify these qualities without the aid of a computer.</p>
