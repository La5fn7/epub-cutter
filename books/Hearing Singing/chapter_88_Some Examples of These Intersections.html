<p>RULES OF THUMB To summarize, pitch and roughness generally relate to the position of a formant within the harmonic series. Tone color, however, is related to the central frequency of that formant. The harmonics we see in a spectrum or spectrogram move freely through that tone color space. This points to the following three complementary patterns at the intersection of pitch, auditory roughness, and tone color: 1. If the fundamental frequency changes while a resonance stays the same, the roughness and pitch resolution of the resulting formant may change. Once the resonance sits between low-integer multiples of the frequency of vocal fold oscillation, the vowel quality may neutralize. 2. If the fundamental frequency stays the same while the resonance speeds up or slows down (raises or lowers its frequency), the resulting formant may move in and out of roughness and pitch resolution as it changes tone color. 3. If the resonance speeds up its frequency proportional to an increase in the frequency of the fundamental (sometimes called formant tracking), the roughness and pitch resolution of that formant will remain basically stable as its tone color changes. Some Examples of These Intersections The above framework helps to explain easily observed phenomena. For example, as pitch rises, the sound of a voice qualitatively simplifies. A soprano‚Äôs high F6 stimulates an objectively less-complex percept when compared to a bass‚Äôs F2. The F6 is likely devoid of any auditory roughness</p>

<p>or unresolved harmonics, and its fundamental oscillates faster than every tone color below |~a|. Midrange examples also benefit from a similar thought experiment. Consider the four examples in figure 10.4 (a‚Äìd) showing waveforms (left) and spectra (right) that were generated by the Madde voice synthesizer. All four have the same set of resonances, which correspond to an average [a]. At G2 (a), there are separate formants (F 1 and F 2) related to the first and second resonances (f R1 and f R2). Those resonances also fall above the fifth harmonic (5f o), so the vowel‚Äôs defining quality is buzzy. Much of this spectrum is unresolved and contributes noise rather than pitch. An octave higher at G3 (b), there are still two vowel formants, although they are less buzzy and less noisy. An octave higher again at G4 (c) is markedly different. Gone are the separate formant peaks for each of the lowest two resonances. Because the pitch is higher, that portion of the spectrum is now entirely pure, with auditory roughness reserved for higher formants in the spectrum. All the harmonics shown resolve into the pitch. An additional octave higher at G5 (d) shows scant evidence that the complex peaks present at G2 were ever present. Gone too is any tone color below the primary peak of 1f o. This demonstrates that voices obligatorily ‚Äúsimplify‚Äù in timbre in very specific ways as pitch rises, and that at least for this vowel, much of that change occurs by the bottom of the treble staff.</p>

Note too that the waveforms (figure 10.4, left) all have the same timescale. Moving from G2 (a) to G3 (b) halves the period duration.

<p>period duration. Since the resonances have not changed, the waveform always starts out the same. The pitch determines how far through that pattern the resonance continues to oscillate.</p>
