<p>spectrograms. The cochlea converts these stimuli into electrical impulses which are sent to the brain. A More Complex Model of the Ear A more detailed model could consider the shape of one‚Äôs shoulders, head, and pinna as factors in gathering pressure waves from the environment. The auditory canal has its own resonance centered approximately between 2,700 and 3,300 Hz,13 and pressure waves are reshaped as they pass through on their way to the eardrum. The motion of the tympanic membrane in response to incoming changes in air pressure sets the ossicles into a pattern of mechanical vibration. What had been acoustic energy‚Äîvibrations of air molecules‚Äîtransforms into the mechanical vibration of these tiny bones that are free to move along one rotational axis each. Their physical characteristics amplify energy in the 1,000 Hz to 1,500 Hz range.14 The combined effect of the resonances of the outer and middle ear (the auditory canal and the ossicles), significantly increases the sensitivity of the human ear to a wide range of frequencies between approximately 1,000 Hz and 3,500 Hz. This is the range of many of the vocal tract resonances favored in speech. We see the effect of this in the equal- loudness contours (see figure 3.2) with notable dips (increased sensitivity) at 1,000 Hz and 3,000 Hz and a general increased sensitivity between approximately 300 Hz and 5,000 Hz. In this image, greater sensitivity is indicated by a lower vertical axis value. The ear is dramatically less sensitive at very low and very high frequencies (a higher vertical axis value).</p>

Source: https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Equal_loudness_no_capt ion.svg These sensitivity differences between low and high frequencies grow smaller the more intense the stimulus is (contours that start at a higher vertical value). They grow larger as intensity drops. In what follows, I will argue that specific, qualitatively opposable aspects of the timbre of the radiated sound of a voice correlate well with specific functional adjustments of the singing body. Our sensitivity to these signifiers of functional listening will vary with distance to the singer and intensity of their singing. This means that the sound of their voice will differ in a small</p>

<p>studio compared to a concert hall and that it may be easier to hear these important qualities when physically closer to a singer. This also means that an amplified singer may offer one a more direct sense of the underlying vocal function as their signal is captured prior to much propagation in a space. The mechanical vibrations of the ossicles terminate at the footplate of the final bone, the stapes. This footplate acts like a piston that pushes into and pulls out of the cochlea, setting the cochlear fluid into motion. The area of the tympanic membrane is greater than that of the footplate of the stapes. This means the ossicles not only transfer the mechanical vibration of the tympanic membrane to the inner ear but also step up the amplitude of the pressure wave introduced into the fluid-filled cochlea. This overcomes the higher resistance (impedance) of the cochlear fluid compared to the less dense air on either side of the tympanic membrane.15 The cochlea (see figure 3.3) contains two main fluid-filled tubes‚Äîone situated adjacent to the other‚Äîthat spiral from the base to the apex of its structure. The ascending tube (base to apex) receives the vibration of the stapes and is called the scala vestibuli. The descending tube (apex to base) is called the scala tympani. Between these two tubes is a third, called the cochlear duct. The boundary between the scala vestibuli and the cochlear duct is called the vestibular (or Reisner‚Äôs) membrane, and it allows pressure waves from the scala vestibuli to enter the cochlear duct. The boundary between the cochlear duct and scala tympani is a variably flexible structure called the basilar membrane. The basilar membrane plays an active role in frequency-filtering pressure waves as they propagate through the cochlear duct.</p>

<p>stapes. This fluid is called perilymph. The fluid in the cochlear duct is called endolymph. The response of the basilar membrane to pressure changes is organized tonotopically, which literally means ‚Äúfrequency place.‚Äù Near its base (where the footplate of the stapes introduces vibration into the scala vestibuli), the basilar membrane is sensitive to high-frequency sounds. Toward the apex, it is sensitive to low frequency sounds (see figure 3.4).16 In broader conceptual terms, we have once again arrived at a model that appears to align with what we see on a spectrum or spectrogram. The basilar membrane takes the complex wave delivered to it by a variety of acoustical and physical means and divides it into pressure patterns of differing frequencies.

However, the basilar membrane is not an isolated structure, nor does it filter pressure patterns as a Fourier transform does (more on this in chapter 6).17 Adjacent to the basilar membrane (and within the cochlear duct) is a complex of structures called the organ of Corti which contains thousands of tiny hairlike cells called stereocilia (see again figure 3.3).</p>

<p>When a specific region on the basilar membrane moves in response to a pressure wave of a specific frequency, the adjacent stereocilia cells are bent. This triggers an electrical signal which travels through the cochlear nerve to the brain. The basilar membrane accomplishes frequency filtering by means of its nonuniform stiffness. At the base of the cochlea, where the stapes introduces vibration, the basilar membrane is stiff and narrow. Toward the apex of the cochlea, the basilar membrane is wider and more flexible. It may not be intuitive to think of the response of a physical membrane in terms of its resonant properties, but the change in the stiffness of the basilar membrane along its length means that it is best able to move at fast rates of change where it is narrow and stiff (at the base). Slower rates of change find compliance closer to the apex, where the membrane is more flexible. Its resonant properties then change along its length. This means that a low-frequency pure tone co-presented with a high-frequency pure tone will literally stimulate two different physical locations along the basilar membrane. However, the input to the cochlea is typically not a pure tone. The pressure pattern in the air is almost always a complex wave. In fact, it is typically a complex wave that is the combination of simultaneous complex sounds from multiple sources. As that complex wave propagates through the cochlea, different moments in the wave capture both the amplitude and rate of change in pressure. This suggests that as this wave travels within the cochlea‚Äîrising and falling in pressure at different rates over time‚Äîa given point on the basilar membrane will move when the rate of pressure change best matches its physical resonance. It is not so much that specific stereocilia are sensitive to specific frequencies. It is more that the basilar membrane is generally resistant to moving in response to any frequencies save for those that align with how flexible it is at a given point. If it can react, it does. If it reacts, it stimulates those stereocilia. With a pure tone, the pattern of pressure change is simple and oscillates between high and low values. This generates a sustained resonance response in the corresponding region of the basilar membrane. A periodic, complex wave will repeatedly stimulate similar regions of the</p>

<p>basilar membrane, but this pattern of local stimulation likely changes throughout the period, as explored in this chapter. As a pressure wave progresses toward its frequency-related location along the basilar membrane, it gradually rises to a pressure maximum. Thereafter, the wave quickly stops physically displacing the membrane. This suggests that a strong stimulation of the basilar membrane in response to lower frequency pressure patterns may cast a masking shadow over the portion of the membrane that responds to a higher frequency stimulus.18 The lower frequency tone may partially or completely prevent one from hearing the higher frequency tone. The basilar membrane does not have infinitely detailed frequency resolution. When an area of the basilar membrane moves in response to vibrations of a given frequency, the adjacent stereocilia will also respond to a lesser degree. This overlapping region is called a critical band of hearing. Any two separate, near-similar stimuli affecting adjacent physical regions of the basilar membrane may result in literal crossed wires as the brain is challenged to untangle which response came from which stimulus. This is the physiological basis for the phenomenon of auditory roughness, a ‚Äúbuzzy‚Äù percept, which is explored in chapter 7. Finally, the basilar membrane itself is organized almost logarithmically, much like pitch. This means that the critical bands of hearing encompass wider frequency ranges from the low-frequency apex to the high- frequency base. For now, keep in mind that as a complex pressure wave passes over the basilar membrane, the higher frequency energy in the wave is more likely to fill in critical bands of hearing while potentially being partially masked by lower frequency energy. In this manner, the inner ear limits the information that it passes along the cochlear nerve to allow the brain to establish the details of the auditory scene. As complex as these models are, they do not approach the complexity of the actual process of hearing. Several key dynamics are left for later consideration. First, the brain receives electrical impulses from different lengths of the basilar membrane at slightly different times, and it receives the same pressure wave at different times in each ear. The brain extracts meaning and assembles the structure of the auditory scene from these</p>

<p>timing differences. Second, the cochlea is not a passive structure that transfers vibrations from the outer world into the brain. It actively reacts to stimulation, to our thoughts and intensions, and to our predictions informed by our experiences. It is, quite literally, powered by the brain, which regulates sensitivity, amplifies quieter sounds, and directs our attention. Finally, and maybe most importantly for musicians, the brain appears to respond to ear training. One can learn to hear with greater specificity and detail. Notwithstanding that hearing is much more complex, a midlevel model of the ear lays the groundwork for many of the ideas that follow: 1. The ear receives complex stimuli and reshapes them by means of the varying resonances of the ear canal, ossicles, and basilar membrane. The effect of these filters varies with the intensity of the stimulus, and different regions of the basilar membrane respond to different frequencies. 2. The basilar membrane has resolution limitations. Any stimulus falling within the critical band of another stimulus will trigger auditory roughness. These critical bands are not fixed along the basilar membrane. They are a dynamic response to stimuli and can start and end anywhere along the membrane. 3. The resulting signal becomes a series of electrical impulses interpreted by the brain by means of pattern analysis.19 Taken together, these ideas prepare us for an end-to-end model for understanding the acoustical and psychoacoustical phenomenon of voice production. Such a model would begin with the response of the vocal tract</p>
