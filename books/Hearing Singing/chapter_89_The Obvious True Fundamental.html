<p>THE OBVIOUS TRUE FUNDAMENTAL I sang professionally as a countertenor, a voice type that spends much time on the treble staff. Thus, my initial exploration of the psychoacoustics of the singing voice focused on registration on and above the treble staff. Consequential timbral changes occur in this pitch range, many of which characterize voice type and genre. At the time (the first two decades of the twenty-first century), much of the literature surrounding voice acoustics centered on cisgender male voices singing as tenors and baritones (and sometimes basses) in classical genres. This work was disproportionately preoccupied with the acoustic output of tenors, especially tenors singing ‚Äúmoney‚Äù notes. Thankfully this is changing, but work remains to be done to understand treble voices with equivalent thoroughness. Based on our explorations so far, consider the following: Around approximately C4 (~262 Hz), the ASTC of the fundamental (1f o) is |~u|, while the second harmonic (2f o) crosses a perceptual threshold from |~u| to |~o|. Below C4, both 1f o and 2f o fall entirely within |~u|. This means the fundamental (1f o) potentially conveys a unique tone color starting at and above C4. Whether it is expressed or not depends entirely on the rest of the spectrum. I repeat that sine waves are an interesting idea, but they rarely exist in nature. But in a way of thinking, the color of 1f o at and above the pitch C4 is an exception, much like a clear harmonic in overtone singing. A strong 1f o at and above C4 is potentially perceptually separable from the rest of the spectrum, especially if the pitch and vowel give it high amplitude as a resonance. See again Figure 8.2 for an example of a persistent, high-intensity 1f o even as vowels change. The fundamental in common between that [u] and [i] is perceptually separable, will never exhibit auditory roughness or unresolved noise, and perceptually behaves like a pure tone. That is to say, we may learn to hear its simple ASTC. No other harmonic tends to generate this percept so dependably, although I will share counterexamples later in this chapter.</p>

<p>I call this the obvious true fundamental. Obvious refers to how its tone color contrasts with the rest of the spectrum. True fundamental refers to the fact that while it only contributes a portion of the pitch percept, this contribution functions as the tone color of a pure tone equivalent to the pitch. The remainder of the pitch percept is then composed of missing fundamentals, with brighter tone colors generated by faster formants. Because classical trebles often shape their vocal tract to continuously align their lowest vocal tract resonance with the first harmonic as pitch ascends‚Äîremember, this resonance strategy is called whoop 5 or hoot 6 ‚Äî this harmonic is often significantly boosted to become more intense than the rest of the spectrum.7 This means that regardless of the additional, within-period oscillations of resonances, the pitch period is characterized by one large ripple from low to high pressure, and then back to low. Richard Miller (2004) similarly suggests, ‚ÄúAmong prominent female artists, when they are singing in [the] upper range, the first formant and the fundamental are often enhanced and exhibit increased acoustic energy in the lower portion of the spectrum.‚Äù8 This causes a portion of the total vowel percept to be significantly defined by the simple ASTC of the obvious true fundamental, rather than by the perceptual qualities of more-complex formants that may be found in the lower pitch range of the voice. As pitch rises through and above the treble staff, we recall that the absolute spectral tone color of a pure tone would pass through |~u|, |~o|, |~…î|, |~…ë|, and (at the upper extreme) |~a|. Endogenous testosterone puberty singers may spend their entire life singing with their fundamental in the |~u| tone color. This means that treble voices singing with a strong fundamental will experience timbral shifts around C5 (shift from |~u| to |~o|), F#5 (|~o| to |~…î|), C6 (|~…î| to |~…ë|), and to |~a| by F‚ôØ6, regardless of their target vowel. These obligate tone color changes do not necessarily characterize the complete timbre of that treble singer, but they will absolutely color those transitional pitch regions. Richard Miller (2000) places a soprano‚Äôs acoustic registration transitions at approximately C‚ôØ5, F‚ôØ5, and C‚ôØ6, which maps well to this schema.9</p>

<p>Miller gives mezzo-sopranos and contraltos slightly lower transitional pitch points, perhaps implying that some aspect of this registration is physiological. For an equal amount of physical ease, the pitch range of the first vocal tract resonance may lie lower for lower voice types, making corresponding resonance tuning transitions easier at slightly lower pitches. However, the similarity of these pitches to the obligatory shifts in the ASTC of the first harmonic (independent of vowel) may suggest that these particular registration points rest on a significant psychoacoustic component as well. The expectation of how a vowel percept will change as pitch rises may then be a combination of perceptual and physical considerations.10 You may wish to record treble singers and pass-filter the fundamental to note the way in which the resulting tone color will change from the bottom to above the top of the treble staff. See Lab #25. Taken with predictable changes in auditory roughness and pitch resolution, the change in the tone color of the fundamental (1f o) appears to explain paralinguistic changes in the timbre of a treble singer as pitch rises. Looking at registration in this way accommodates the reality that lower-timbred (dark) voices do not sound the same as higher-timbred (bright) voices as they execute comparable acoustic registration events. For example, a contralto singing an [o] at an A4 may enter whoop registration (1f o : f R1 ), but a soprano may delay this shift until D5. Those obvious true fundamentals will elicit different tone color percepts at those two pitches; correspondingly, these voices will sound different. The contralto‚Äôs fundamental will contribute a strong |~u| at A4 that in a soprano voice will be much weaker at the same pitch and vowel combination. A soprano will contribute an |~o| when they reach whoop registration (1f o : f R1 ) around the pitch D4. This maps intuitively to the idea that a darker-timbred voice achieves that darkness from profiling the tone colors of their relatively lower frequency formants. The lens of ASTC is tied to frequency. From this perspective, higher sung pitches are perceptually different from lower sung pitches in a way that deserves consideration. Practitioners working primarily with lower voices may not be aware of this. Practitioners who conceive of the soprano voice as functionally identical to a tenor voice an octave higher</p>

<p>may not be primed to notice this. It is my hope that such practitioners join other subsets of voice educators in engaging these phenomena using the ASTC framework. This material has direct, wide-ranging, demonstrable application in the singing voice studio.</p>
