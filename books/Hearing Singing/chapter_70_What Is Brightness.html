<p>WHAT IS BRIGHTNESS? In the voice pedagogy and vocology literature, any discussion of frequency tends to reference values in cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). For example, a soprano singing an A5 may generate a strong fundamental at 880 Hz. A tenor‚Äôs voice may feature a prominent cluster of resonances around 2,900 Hz. A rock singer may have persistent energy between 6 kHz and 12 kHz. But how do these frequency ranges differ? Using objective measurements is a simple and granular way to discuss frequency, but it is one devoid of qualitative information. For example, is 1,000 Hz as different in brightness from 500 Hz as 2,000 Hz is from 1,500 Hz? Can meaningful comparisons be framed in these terms? Those who grapple with these questions tend to use the term brightness to discuss the frequency spectrum. Frequency tells us something measurable about a repeating pattern. Brightness honors the perception that high-frequency tones are characteristically different from low-frequency tones.4 A deeper understanding of brightness would acknowledge qualitative oppositions between low- and high-frequency pure tones. It would also suggest that two pure tones that share a common frequency are similarly bright. This does not suggest that sounds with the same pitch are automatically similarly bright. Nor does it suggest that two sounds with a similar spectral peak will sound the same overall. Likewise, two pure tones need not share all aspects of timbre to share brightness. For example, perhaps only one source has vibrato or amplitude pulsing. However, a stimulus at a given frequency will generally elicit a consistent brightness percept, regardless of source. Perhaps the strictest view of brightness would suggest that anything more complex than a pure tone can be understood through this principle, but only with caveats. I suggest that the various spectral peaks within a single, steady-state vowel can be considered to have different brightnesses, but this assumes one has chosen to attend to the sound in detail in the first place. Even the lowest two spectral peaks‚Äîthe vowel formants (F 1 and F 2)‚Äîcan be thought of as each having a certain</p>

<p>brightness, although the short syllable duration and relatively low pitch of speech obscures such details. The brightness of a vowel formant is typically less bright than that of higher frequency energy, but it is brighter than lower frequency energy. How perceptually different such peaks may be from one another depends on how near or far they are from one another on the brightness scale. In the percept of the listener, those peaks may interact in complex ways, but they coexist along the same perceptual continuum as more obviously bright and dark pure tones. This is all to say, the colors we perceive to be present in a voice are all shades of tone color on the same continuous scale of brightness that characterizes any sound. What follows explores the long history of these ideas, establishes limits on the extent of this phenomenon, explicates a framework for encountering the tone colors of pure tones, and explains how one might extrapolate the multiple tone colors present in complex tones.</p>
