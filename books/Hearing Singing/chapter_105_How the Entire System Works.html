<p>HOW THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WORKS I wrote at the beginning of this book that the voice pedagogy and vocology literature tends to subdivide the singing body into subsystems. These subsystems tend to form chapters in voice pedagogy and vocology books, and we draw upon adjacent fields to present an interdisciplinary framing of the material. Conceptually, cognition and neuroscience must sit at the beginning, although this is only now entering the literature. The skeletal and muscular systems follow. Respiration is presented separately from phonation. Resonance may or may not be presented separately from acoustics. And articulation is left until the end. I do not argue against this organization, although I think we should certainly tack on cognition to the beginning, and radiation and perception to the end of this list, and situate the entre venture in the context of how we learn and communicate. However, what I do argue against is any hint that these systems are actually separable. In this subsection, I want to introduce a model for thinking about how the singing body works. Yes, the brain is likely the most important instigator, but understanding how the physical body works as a functional whole while singing offers immense value and fertile opportunity for insight. Yes, these ideas could be expressed far more compactly with mathematical formulas, but our minds respond to narratives. Thanks in large part to the work of Ingo Titze, you may have already encountered the idea that the voice has nonlinear properties.3 Indeed, the steps involved in phonation do not describe a linear system. Each of its subsystems needs to transfer energy (the ability to do work) to the next subsystem. The way the body does this is through asymmetries and time lag. Respiration does not drive phonation, which drives resonation, which then creates the</p>

<p>voice. Respiration tries to start phonation, but phonation lags a little in its response. Similarly, the excitation of the vocal tract by phonation lags the oscillation of the vocal folds. These are the asymmetries that allow energy to transfer from one subsystem to the next. In a way of thinking about it, the ability to do work is temporarily stored in the next subsystem as it is transferred, almost like storing up power in a battery, only to immediately discharge it. Because this energy spends a moment interacting with the next subsystem before being released, the properties of each subsystem can affect the nature of that release. At the core of the concept of nonlinearity is the idea that the input of a system is not proportional to its output. A linear system would output one widget for every unit of energy you put into the widget machine. A nonlinear system does not work this way. A nonlinear system might output one widget per energy unit for some portion of the potential energy input range, but then start to output exponentially more widgets per energy unit above a certain threshold. There may even be a middle region of peak efficiency, with a weak(er) output below and above that threshold. But in the ‚Äúsweet spot‚Äù‚Äîthe middle of that range‚Äîthe output appears to outpace the input. For example, anyone who drives an internal combustion engine car knows that fuel efficiency (your miles per gallon) peaks around highway speeds. Broadly speaking, the voice compares nicely to this kind of nonlinear system. Each subsystem does not just transfer energy to the next subsystem. It does so with a potential range of reactions, which can vary the output of the entire system and even modify the behavior of the upstream system. As I related back in chapter 3, a basic model of the singing body would describe that the pressurized air below the vocal folds causes them to oscillate. That pattern of oscillations is filtered by the vocal tract and radiated as the sound. Let‚Äôs spend a little time revisiting</p>
