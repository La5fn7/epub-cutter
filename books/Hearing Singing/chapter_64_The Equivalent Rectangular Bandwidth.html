<p>THE EQUIVALENT RECTANGULAR BANDWIDTH A strict definition of auditory roughness suggests that at low frequencies, critical bands are wider in terms of musical intervals and narrower in terms of the difference in frequency.17 , 18 Think of this as an inversely proportional relationship that does not matter for much of the pitch range singers occupy. The higher the frequencies of the competing tones, the narrower the musical interval and wider the difference in frequency. To account for the nonlinear response curve of the basilar membrane, we must turn to the equivalent rectangular bandwidth formula to discern whether any two specific tones will trigger auditory roughness. With a little care, this formula may be entered into a spreadsheet app, or you may calculate it manually. Howard and Angus attest that this formula works so long as the center frequency of the critical band (f c) is expressed in kHz and falls between 100 Hz and 10 kHz. ERB = 24.7 * ((4.37 * fc) + 1) Hz Here are two examples where the ERB does a better job of explaining the presence of auditory roughness than either the musical interval or raw frequency difference between two tones: Pure tones at G2 (~100 Hz) and C3 (~130 Hz) will exhibit a similar roughness as pure tones at C6 (~1,059 Hz) and D6 (~1,189 Hz). In this example, solving for G2 (~100 Hz, or 0.1 kHz for the formula) gives a bandwidth of 35.5 Hz. As C3 (~130 Hz) is just within that range, the ERB formula predicts that it will trigger roughness. Listening to this dyad confirms it. Similarly, the solution given C6 (~1,059 Hz, or 1.059 kHz for the formula) is a range of 139 Hz. D6 (~1,189 Hz) also falls just within this range, which can be confirmed by listening. Notably, the same musical fourth between the G2 and C3 would trigger no auditory roughness between a C6 and F6. It is interesting that lower-sung fundamentals could conceivably produce harmonic energy capable of triggering the roughness caused by harmonics at G2 and C3 (which would have to be 3f o and 4f o of the pitch C1). Keep in mind that sung pitches this low are uncommon but not unheard of. See Lab #11.</p>

<p>Considering significantly higher pitches momentarily, an interdependent relationship with the 5 kHz pitch perception cutoff seems to emerge. In other words, even if harmonics greater than 5f o no longer fell within the ERB, they would trigger a different kind of noise anyway. Let us explore this with an example: Plug the pitch F5 (~699 Hz) into the ERB formula, and it returns a bandwidth of 402 Hz for the fifth harmonic (5f o). Because the sixth harmonic (6f o) must be 699 Hz faster than (5f o), auditory roughness should be reduced in this part of the harmonic series at this and higher fundamentals. However, the energy represented by those higher harmonics soon crosses the upper threshold of pitch perception itself (around 5 kHz). You absolutely must listen to this for yourself. I certainly perceive a difference in quality between lower and higher harmonics in this pitch range, and the same buzzy label applied to lower pitches makes sense here as well, even if it occurs by a different mechanism. This is an underexplored area of perception, and I hope that more work will be done to identify these thresholds. See Lab #12. In chapters 3 and 6, I touched on the idea that the persistent energy we see in a spectrum or spectrogram at integer multiples of the fundamental is not the same thing as a chord of pure tones from independent sources. Those independent pure tones would each be a separate, persistently oscillating fundamental. Remember, harmonics are a way to understand the complexity of a repeating pattern. Harmonics may represent persistent oscillations of pressure that carry over from period to period or pressure changes that quickly dampen per glottal cycle. I encourage you to be open to the apparent paradox in this model. Even if the harmonic view clearly predicts auditory roughness, it may do so because it effectively summarizes the complex pattern that stimulates the basilar membrane. It is the response of the basilar membrane to that complex stimulus that generates this percept. We do not need to conceive of harmonics as functioning in a way that is equivalent to separately produced pure tones at the same frequencies, even though it is convenient to model them this way. So, what voice functions should trigger auditory roughness? Or put another way, for what aspects of singing might auditory roughness act as</p>

<p>a confirmation that the function has been achieved? This could be a brighter vowel, a heavier registration, an increase in the vertical contact depth of the vocal folds, a narrowing in the vocal tract, an acoustic tuning that assists the supraglottal impulses to drop in pressure more quickly, moving from breathy to flow phonation or from flow to pressed phonation. Noisier and more extreme ways of singing will leverage this percept as well. As a reasonable rule of thumb for reading a spectrum, anything that brings more energy into the spectrum of a periodic sound above the fifth harmonic (5f o) will trigger auditory roughness. In practical terms, in normal phonation anything that increases the speed of the supraglottal pressure drop per glottal cycle and allows pressure changes much faster than 5fo in the vocal tract will increase energy in the brighter part of the spectrum and likely trigger auditory roughness. Think of the buzziness of auditory roughness as the cognitive experience of a sound the ear cannot fully interpret. Auditory roughness is the sound of aural confusion. It is the sound of stimulating multiple frequencies within a critical band of hearing. In the context of how slippery a percept timbre can be,19 the presence of auditory roughness dependably signals which specific kinds of spectral energy are present.</p>
