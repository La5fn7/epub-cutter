<p>THE BURDEN OF WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT THE VOICE It is an old idea to demonstrate mastery over a subject area for the purpose of developing one‚Äôs own narrative as an authority. Harold Bloom (1997) terms this ‚Äúthe anxiety of influence,‚Äù and it proves a useful framework beyond Bloom‚Äôs field of literary criticism.3 Musicologists similarly understand compositions from the past as a weight that hangs on modern composers, demanding their acknowledgement and reaction.4 Voice pedagogy literature is frequently characterized by this tension. It is common to see new texts that incorporate existing and emerging research well before either the science is settled or the practical application is clear, because the existing body of material must still be acknowledged, appropriated, transformed, commented upon, and somehow reconciled within any new work. Without a credible connection to what is known more broadly, the new work may not survive the comparison. Off to the dustbin for the works of such charlatans, one might blithely suggest. Here is an example: The publication of the first edition of Gray‚Äôs Anatomy in 1858 speaks to the increasingly widespread dissemination of anatomical knowledge in the nineteenth century. Nineteenth-century pedagogues were forced to confront the emerging scientific fields of anatomy and physiology and to reconcile this information with their own views. This is not a bad thing, of course. However, Bloom might suggest that the nineteenth-century treatise authors who left anatomy and physiology unaddressed would have a harder time convincing their readers of their authority. For example, Giovanni Battista Lamperti uses specific anatomical language to indicate the appropriate location of sensations while singing: ‚ÄúAs we said before, the resonance must be felt on top of the</p>

<p>head about where the parietal bone joins the frontal bone (frontoparietal suture).‚Äù5 This is a level of nuance and anatomical specificity‚Äîjust say ‚Äúthe top of your head‚Äù if that is what you mean ‚Äîthat few of his students likely benefited from. This may seem like a historical curiosity until we ask ourselves how many modern voice pedagogy texts continue to foreground facts about the body as though exposure to information is an end unto itself? Twentieth- (and now twenty-first) century voice pedagogy texts similarly confront the science of acoustics, made widely accessible by the research and publications surrounding the creation and distribution of the telephone. A modern voice pedagogy textbook chapter about voice acoustics would be incomplete without the spectra, spectrograms, formant plot graphs, or, later, the International Phonetic Alphabet and vowel quadrilateral generated by twentieth-century research into speech and sound transmission. Assumptions about the utility of the acoustical models used to study the human voice have been passed down from generation to generation by authors who (perhaps unconsciously) incorporated older material to demonstrate their command of what was known. Transmitting the information represented by such models (for example, where various vowel formants are or what the contribution of the vocal folds is) does not mean that the teacher understands the implications any more than the student does. In fact, this lack of deep understanding may cause a voice pedagogy teacher to perpetuate their own experience as a former student: They teach the material because they feel they are supposed to understand it, whether they do or not. Think about your own exposure to some basic concepts related to perception. For example, it is common to find statements in the voice pedagogy literature like: (1) Pitch is the cognitive experience of frequency; (2) timbre is everything besides pitch and loudness;</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 41</h3>

<p>(3) different vowels have different formants; or (4) the ear carries out frequency filtering. Each of these statements is true at a model level. However, they do not necessarily tell you much about the nature of the phenomena they summarize or point to deeper implications. Models for understanding scientific aspects of voice pedagogy have never been so widely shared, but the models themselves‚Äî which are generally simplified to characterize an aspect of singing within the context of a scientific study‚Äîmay fail to connect to our sense of reality. Upon close inspection, they may hinder our ability to imagine the reality of a singing voice itself, promoting confusion and even backlash. Command of models, rather than the ability to make connections and generate effective outcomes, becomes currency. We may need to reevaluate Vennard‚Äôs claim that experts are those who know facts and the rest are charlatans, when those who trade in facts they do not fully understand perhaps deserve that label as well.</p>
