<p>THE TWO-TIMBRE MODEL AND BEYOND By conceptually dividing the spectrum into a pure portion and a buzzy portion‚Äîand by further anticipating that the higher-frequency parts of that buzzy portion trigger pitch-less, noisy qualities‚Äîwe can now map these ideas onto our familiar models of voice register and quality. This allows us to note qualitatively-opposable percepts in the otherwise prohibitively-complex experience of timbre. My aim is to answer Donald Miller‚Äôs (2008) call to ‚Äúfree . . . hearing from the prison of subjectivity,‚Äù21 albeit without ultimately relying on the real-time visual feedback of a spectrum or spectrogram. To do so, let us first explore how these percepts associate with qualitatively opposable vocal functions. It is challenging to try to discuss registration and registers in print. For the next image, I will use shorthand to indicate the difference between what most singers will understand to be their chest register (their speaking-pitch range) and their falsetto or head register (their weaker upper pitch range). Herbst and ≈†vec (2014) suggest that the former is characterized by engagement of the thyroarytenoid (TA) muscles that make up the body of the vocal folds and the latter is characterized by the relative lack of that muscular engagement.22 The nature of the glottis is also affected by the engagement of the muscles that position the arytenoid cartilages at the posterior end of the vocal folds (the ‚Äê interarytenoid, lateral cricoarytenoid, and posterior cricoarytenoid muscles), and the muscles that help to tilt the thyroid and cricoid cartilages to stretch the vocal folds (the cricothyroid muscles). But TA+ (thyroarytenoid engaged) and TA‚àí (thyroarytenoid not engaged) point well to the gross role of the thyroarytenoid muscles in determining what might be called ‚Äúlaryngeal register.‚Äù These terms likely do not map intuitively to every singer‚Äôs sense of their singing registration, which is generally not binary in a practical sense. However, most people can yodel and notice the qualitative difference below and above that flip. Figure 7.6 shows schematic spectra of the theoretical spectral slopes of the vocal fold impulse train in falsetto (TA‚àí) and chest (TA+) registers</p>

<p>based on thyroarytenoid engagement. Note that relative to falsetto register, chest register has more energy in higher harmonics. The pure and buzzy regions are overlaid. Notice that buzziness is a more prominent perceptual feature in chest than in falsetto. Figure 7.7 similarly displays voice source qualities as discussed by Sundberg with the pure and buzzy regions overlaid.23 This suggests that one practical way of identifying these voice qualities may be in terms of the ratio of pure and buzzy. Figure 7.6 suggests that chest is characterized by the presence of buzziness. Compare figure 7.7 to figure 7.6. Note that moving from breathy phonation to flow phonation similarly adds more buzzy, higher harmonic energy, while moving from pressed phonation to flow phonation adds pure warmth.

<p>Figure 7.7 Schematic of spectra of voice source qualities with pure and buzzy perceptual regions indicated. Source: Author, based on Sundberg, The Science of the Singing Voice, 79. The theoretical transglottal airflow patterns associated with these three phonation qualities are illustrated in figure 7.8. Breathy phonation features a high overall airflow rate that never reaches zero airflow. This is true even during the contacting portion of the breathy glottal cycle. The drop in flow shown at the beginning and end of the cycle is slow for breathy phonation relative to the flow and pressed qualities. This means the acceleration of the drop in pressure of the supraglottal air mass is slower for breathy phonation, which is why the faster (higher frequency) components present in pressed and flow are missing from that spectrum. Any brightness in breathy phonation tends to be stochastic turbulence. The flow and pressed patterns share the faster drop in airflow as the folds contact, but the total volume of transglottal airflow is much higher for flow phonation than pressed.</p>

<p>Figure 7.8 Transglottal airflow patterns of the three voice qualities from figure 7.7. One glottal cycle is shown here. Source: Author after Sundberg, The Science of the Singing Voice, 85. Keep in mind that these patterns are the result of the interplay of tracheal pressure, glottal resistance, the various adjustments of the vocal folds, and the flow resistance of the vocal tract. Also keep in mind that this shows airflow patterns that facilitate the supraglottal impulse‚Äîthe interaction of both laryngeal and vocal tract dynamics‚Äîrather than that impulse itself. Still, key features of figure 7.8 should map well to the source impulse spectra in figure 7.7. These three voice qualities are interrelated functionally: Breathy and flow feature high transglottal flow volumes; flow and pressed feature a rapid cessation (or decline) of flow. This suggests that they may be used to bridge the gap between workable and unworkable functions, especially if we replace the somewhat pejorative terms breathy and pressed with a continuum of vocal fold adduction. This adduction may be caused by muscular effort, aerodynamic forces, or acoustic forces. I think it is then an attractive notion to float a perceptual definition of chest voice and falsetto (or head voice) based on the presence of auditory roughness. Likewise, mixed registers may be at least partially explained in terms of these perceptual qualities (pure/buzzy) rather than the physiological consistency of their production. This suggests that ‚Äúmix‚Äù is</p>

<p>the presence of brightness at effort levels below that found in full, speech-pitch-range singing. ‚ÄúSeamless‚Äù register transitions may be explained in terms of incremental changes in the presence of auditory roughness as pitch rises or falls. We can tilt toward the stereotypical perceptual signifiers of either falsetto or chest voice anywhere within our singing range by changing our phonation quality or vocal tract shape to rebalance the ratio of pure and buzzy. For example, the use of bright vowels like /e/ or /√¶/ in belt and mix-belt registration facilitates the impression of chest voice‚Äôs buzzy brightness without the TA engagement that would only work in a lower pitch range. Changes in dynamics also impact timbre. Figure 7.9 shows the waveform and three spectra of a cisgender man singing a typical decrescendo. Each spectrum falls under the time range it represents. Notice that the higher frequency parts of the spectrum decrease in intensity faster than the lower frequency parts. The levels of 1f o and 3f o are indicated in each spectrum as a reference. Notice as well that the brighter parts of the spectrum‚Äîthe portion that will elicit auditory roughness‚Äîdrops in intensity faster than the warm part of the spectrum does. Titze (2000) suggests that many things might impact vocal intensity: adductory forces of the vocal folds, air pressure below the glottis in excess of the phonation threshold pressure, formant tuning (acoustical relationships between the vocal folds and vocal tract), general vocal tract adjustments to favor higher frequency energy, or fundamental frequency.24 Each situation sounds a little different, but except in cases of very high fundamental frequencies, a louder version of the same sound will tend to feature more auditory roughness.</p>
