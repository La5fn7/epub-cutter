<p>A FEW IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS AND BITS OF HOUSEKEEPING I have found that understanding the singing voice through a perceptual lens has profoundly impacted the way in which I think about and hear singing. This book is a thorough, slowly-sequenced exploration of that process and how I think about this subject. Please do not get bogged down in the prose when exploring ideas that could be made real with an experiential lab assignment. I will write under the assumption that you will seek out these sounds. None of this journey was abstract for me. It was always about the sounds. The scope of this material does not extend to how a singer fully perceives their own singing body while singing, which is a fabulously complex phenomenon to consider. If we ultimately hear with our brain, that organ receives even more input as a singer than it does as a listener. My hope is to play a helpful part in demystifying this complex framework. The study of radiated sounds appears to be my best initial contribution. Some of the information in this book is difficult because it asks for nuance around currently accepted models. For example, the idea that the vocal folds create harmonics, that ‚Äúbelt‚Äù is a strong second harmonic, or that a vowel‚Äôs dominant tone color is equally encoded across the spectrum. More on this later. I ask that you remain open to new ideas as they emerge and know that my objective is to present information in a helpful manner, regardless of whether it can be made simple enough for a novice. This is not a comprehensive physics, perception, or acoustics book. And because I am interested in more than what is immediately practical in the voice studio, neither is it solely a voice pedagogy book. This text sits somewhere in between and is needed in part due</p>

<p>to translational issues that continue to arise between these communities. The ideas offered here enjoy a great deal of empirical and scientific support, have a long history of thought, and have stood the test of time in my own classroom and teaching studio. If my readers who are musicians are pushed to work harder to read this book than they are by other pedagogy books, and if my readers who are professional scientists raise an eyebrow when I sequence ideas for best consumption by the voice pedagogy and vocology communities, I will have hit the right balance. I will adopt two notation conventions throughout this book. Pitch will be indicated with scientific notation. C4 is middle C. B3 is a half- step below and C5 is an octave above C4. I will also refer to the various aspects of the source-filter model after Titze et al. (2015).2 Harmonics will be notated 1f o, 2f o, 3f o, etc. Resonances of the vocal tract will be notated f R1, f R2, f R3, etc. I will also use this abbreviation to label slower and faster oscillations of air in the vocal tract. Formants will be notated F 1, F 2, F 3, etc. What these terms point to in the context of different conceptual models will be explored throughout. At many points throughout this book, I will reference the idea of a pure tone. In practical terms, this is analogous to a sine wave: a perfectly symmetrical oscillation of pressure that generates no harmonics. If you look at a spectrogram and see harmonics, they have the appearance of a sine tone. In the physical world, this is almost impossible to generate, as any inertia in the vibrating mass or resonating air will skew that pressure pattern. That skewing generates harmonics, even if imperceptibly. In the spirit of describing our experience of a sound over the measurement of a sound, I will tend to use the term pure tone to characterize very simple sounds. This sidesteps the question of whether the sound is completely</p>

<p>sinusoidal or not. When I use the term sine wave, it will be in the context of a mathematical process. Finally, please keep in mind that I will suggest what is possible in terms of perception. I will point to what might be gained from revising our current conceptual and teaching models. It is impossible to receive this information in a vacuum, and I will likely push you to question the conclusions you have already successfully operationalized. This text challenges those models as much as it challenges the reader to experience the voice anew. Again, I encourage you to be patient and to ground the descriptions and explanations on the following pages in the sounds of real singing. Explore these ideas in your environment and allow yourself to be changed in the way that you hear a singing voice. This is going to be an ear-opening experience.</p>
