<p>THOUGHTS ON HOW PERCEPTUAL QUALITIES POINT TO VOCAL FUNCTION At a low pitch, the two-timbre model separation of pure and buzzy may be the most nuance you can bring to functional hearing. On the treble staff, you may be able to more easily hear the separate warm fundamental, the pure and clear peak of a vowel-defining formant, and the general buzziness of higher frequency harmonics. When this buzzy high-frequency energy is clustered in a narrow range, it sounds different than when it is spread out. Above the treble staff the tone color of the fundamental will likely dominate the sound, with the potential for more timbrally simple buzzy brightness. If you teach unamplified singers in a small studio, the warm, buzzy, and possibly bright noisy parts of their voice will have to be a little overrepresented to you to sound balanced in a concert hall at a distance. If you teach amplified singers, make sure you understand the difference between warmth and brightness acoustically and the way that an audio signal chain reshapes the spectrum. Train for the amplified result, but keep in mind that a technically secure voice still has a stable unamplified sound. One of the most useful voice functions is to sing in a chest voice pitch range but easily and quietly enough that you do not generate auditory roughness. You can practice this function across wide pitch ranges. We do not have a good word for this function, but it is the scaffold on which all mixed registration is built. Almost all classical voice registration utilizes a mix of some sort. The exceptions tend to be either lower pitched sounds or very high and exciting ‚Äúmoney notes.‚Äù However, even those sounds exist in the context of a voice that is balanced enough to gradually adjust registration as pitch, loudness, and timbre change.</p>

<p>All things being equal, lower sung pitches will be more timbrally complex than higher sung pitch across multiple parameters. For all but the lowest of basses, much of the singing range crosses into the pitch range where speechlike qualities start to evaporate. This might include the complexity of two vowel formants, the presence of a warm |~u| tone color below those vowel formants, the presence of buzziness or noise in brighter parts of the spectrum, or the reliance on brightness to carry the power of the voice. If singing in a range where the acoustic interactions of the vocal tract start to influence phonation, no resonance typically comes close to the amplitude and power of the first resonance (f R1), specific second resonance (f R2) strategies notwithstanding. Ironically, our ears are typically more sensitive to the bright oscillation of the second and faster resonances (f R2, f R3, etc.). Singing for the brightness first frequently diminishes the warm power of that first resonance. This is more or less appropriate based on aesthetic targets. If singing robust, unamplified music, this may cripple potentially beneficial acoustical interactions. The buzzy sounds we hear in robust singing are generated by the way we hear the higher frequency components of periodic sounds, not the effort we put into making the sound. There will always be a lower frequency spectrum component that has no buzz. It may be quiet, but it is always present. Distorted, growling, and rattling sounds are typically produced by means of a secondary oscillator, either by itself or in combination with the vocal folds. This also means that any vocal fold oscillation can remain both pure and buzzy and fundamentally balanced, even when the entire system is producing a distorted sound. Every successful unamplified solo singer has some sort of brightness inherent in their voice. This is because the act of producing higher amplitude sounds necessarily creates asymmetries</p>

<p>and skewed energy transfers between subsystems. The sound of the faster aspects of these skewed patterns is brightness. Even classical sopranos singing above the treble staff do not just sound like the tone color of their fundamental unless they are singing extremely quietly. Generally speaking, quieter singing works just fine in an amplified context as long as there is some freely produced brightness in the sound. Classical trebles who sing with vibrato may feature strong amplitude pulsations in the brighter parts of the spectrum. It will be easier and ultimately less distracting to attend to the relatively more consistent fundamental when evaluating stability, consistency, and intonation. Breathy sounds are dominated by the warm components of the spectrum. Any brightness is stochastic and tends not to generate buzziness.</p>
