<p>ISSUES WITH THE SINGER‚ÄôS FORMANT AND PITCH The perceptual difference between resolved harmonics (pitch) and unresolved harmonics (pitch-lessness, or buzzy noise) points to an interesting paradox in a commonly accepted phenomenon. For the last half century, the singing community has largely accepted the idea that the singer‚Äôs formant‚Äîsometimes singer‚Äôs formant cluster (SFC)‚Äîis the reason the voice of an endogenous testosterone puberty classical singer can be heard over an orchestra.16 This bright and ringing quality is certainly strong in this kind of voice and frequently stands in for the aesthetic of classical singing, alongside other genre-defining technical choices such as a lowered larynx. Sundberg (2001) defines the SFC thus: The ‚Äúsinger‚Äôs formant‚Äù is a prominent spectrum envelope peak near 3 kHz, typically found in voiced sounds produced by classical operatic singers. . . . It is mainly a resonatory phenomenon produced by a clustering of formants 3, 4, and 5.17 This has been demonstrated by means of masking recordings of singers with noise that imitates the theoretical long-term average spectrum of an orchestra.18 When this masking noise is applied to an endogenous testosterone puberty classical voice free of the SFC, the voice becomes hard to hear. When applied to a voice with the SFC present, that brighter portion of the singer‚Äôs spectrum noticeably occupies a relatively ‚Äúorchestra-free‚Äù frequency band in the spectrum. By contrast, treble voices‚Äîespecially the voices of endogenous estrogen puberty classical sopranos‚Äîare said to not need or use the SFC, especially above the pitch C5.19 This exemption also applies to singers who use electronic amplification. Setting aside the question of whether an orchestra ever produces a continuous sound equivalent to this masking noise‚Äîwhich suggests that we likely frequently hear the rest of the singer‚Äôs spectrum at times‚ÄîI would like to suggest that our understanding and appreciation of</p>

<p>brightness in all singing voices can benefit from more detail and specificity. Practicality drives this rationale, as brightness can present in many ways. Some ways of singing indeed have a strong SFC. Others feature a prominent harmonic lower than the SFC.20 At other times, and especially in contemporary styles of singing, brightness is characterized by the contribution of harmonics higher than the SFC. If the SFC has a more objective technical definition (a specific frequency band amplified by a specific mechanical action), we ought to be able to attach some unambiguous perceptual aspect of the sound to the term. Otherwise, the practical pedagogic value of this term is problematically limited at best; we may as well revert to a general term like brightness instead. Here is a specific example to tease out this issue. Given a SFC centered on 2,800 Hz, a tenor‚Äôs SFC while singing a B ‚ô≠ 4 will be represented on a spectrum by harmonics that are still low enough in the harmonic series to resolve into the pitch (see figure 5.3). If our tenor sings any pitch below about B3 (see figure 5.4), their SFC will likely be perceived as unresolved. It is still a bright and ringing sound, but an unresolved sound, nonetheless. This means the SFC frequency band increasingly contributes more buzzy noise than pitch as pitch drops. Were the SFC truly the only part of the voice that carries over an orchestra, we would hear the voice switch between pitched and pitch-less sounds based on the frequency of the fundamental and the frequency range of the SFC. This is obviously not how the voice behaves.</p>

<p>perspective. In particular, the sheer number of treble voices in the singing community would justify further research into brightness in singing at high(er) fundamentals. Outside of the acoustics lab, this phenomenon is readily observed in situ, as shown in figure 5.5. This figure models an A3 (top) and C‚ôØ4 (bottom) sung by Dmitri Hvorostovsky. The SFC of the C‚ôØ4 clearly resolves into the pitch, but the SFC of A3 takes on a noisy quality that challenges pitch identification. I speculate that identifiable transitions in classical singing voices may yet come to be associated with the transitions of the SFC from unresolved to resolved harmonics (rather than just pitch to pitch). Another way to say this is that as pitch rises, one would expect aspects of the singer‚Äôs sound to transition from a pitch-less buzzy percept to a pitched buzzy percept to a pitched pure percept. This is further covered in chapter 7.</p>

As this is a live recording with orchestra, the frequency regions aligning with Hvorostovsky‚Äôs harmonics are indicated in each image. Note that the SFC for the A3 (top) begins at about the ninth harmonic and extends up to the thirteenth harmonic. The SFC for the C‚ôØ4 (bottom) falls substantially within the range of resolved harmonics.

<p>Note that this is a commercial recording, and as such we must be cautious to assume we have heard exactly what this singer sounded like up close. However, this recording is sufficient for the purpose of demonstrating that his SFC as heard on this recording is not capable of transmitting the pitch percept.</p>
