<p>THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK The sound of a singing voice is ephemeral yet powerful. Perfect harmonies can feel like physical objects in space. Dissonances rub, pulse, and yearn for resolution as though they are aware of their own discomfort. Singing can draw us into the present. It can take us back in time. How can this same act point us to the future or bathe us in nostalgia? How does one even begin to talk about the sound of a singing voice? Can one talk about it? The purpose of this book is to attempt to address this question. Through an experiential and scholarly exploration of simple phenomena tied to sound perception, I will propose an actionable framework for hearing singing. This will take us through several subject areas which will be covered both academically and experientially. We will explore models for understanding the interactive physical and aerodynamic reality of voice production; we will explore how the ear both functions and plays a role in co- creating the sounds of our natural world; we will parse out simple and dependably identifiable aspects of timbre and perception; and ultimately we will find meaningful connections between those percepts and the underlying functional coordinations enabling the singer to produce them. I have observed that the greatest compliment you can give a voice teacher is that they have ‚Äúbig ears.‚Äù The best teachers do not necessarily sing the best; they hear the best. This is a difficult skill to transmit, in part because words alone cannot convey the qualities we prize, nor can they ever completely summarize the numerous patterns that emerge across a student population. Effective training of voice teachers is a labor- and time-intensive process. As a small step toward addressing this challenge, I offer the book that follows.</p>

<p>Perception may be complex and difficult to pin down. However, there are simple ways of understanding the perception of sound (psychoacoustics) that can radically affect how you hear a voice. Acknowledging that the voice is complex, ephemeral, emotional, and culturally situated, I hope to convey to you that certain aspects of a singer‚Äôs sound, understood with nuance and heard by trained ears, can convey technically actionable information to a voice teacher or coach.</p>
