<p>HOW TO UNDERSTAND PHONATION AND RESONANCE IN THE VOCAL TRACT If we are to link what we see in a spectrum to the reality of singing, let us begin with a simple overview of the physical means of voice production and its acoustic output. It may be helpful for the reader to consider that voicing is a multistep process where each step transforms an actual, physical phenomenon. The pressurizing of tracheal air in many ways represents the potential to voice; however, one cannot layer complex aesthetic qualities onto it. The train of air puffs that escape the rapidly opening and contacting vocal folds during phonation are perhaps most simply modeled by a line graph charting transglottal airflow against time.1 The pressure dynamics below, between, and above the vocal folds are also important to understanding the nature of self-sustaining vocal fold oscillation and vocal tract resonance. In normal phonation, air flows from below to above the glottis when the vocal folds are open, and this airflow abruptly drops when they contact. In cases where the vocal folds completely close, this airflow drops to zero. This flow pattern meets a mass of air in the vocal tract, which has inertia. This means that the vocal tract air mass typically responds slightly sluggishly to the ‚Äúnew‚Äù air, which causes a region of supraglottal high pressure to build up. When the glottis closes‚Äîor reaches maximum contacting, depending on the phonation quality‚Äîseveral important things happen: 1. The significant drop (or cessation) in airflow conspires with the higher-pressure supraglottal air mass already moving away from the vocal folds to generate an area of low supraglottal pressure. It is not a true vacuum, but this air rapidly drops well below atmospheric pressure. It may be confusing to make this connection; why would shutting off airflow make the</p>

<p>pressure drop? Consider that pressure here is a measure of the amount of air in a space. It is density. If the air above the glottis is moving away and no new air is introduced to replace it, the density (and therefor pressure) drops. 2. When the vocal folds are in contact, the vocal tract becomes a more effective resonator. In simple terms, if you understand resonance as the bouncing of pressure waves back and forth between the base of the pharynx and the opening of the mouth (or nose), that process is more efficient if you do not allow that pressure wave to enter into and be absorbed by the lungs. Since the contacting vocal folds reduce the rate of airflow faster than they ramp up the rate of airflow as they are opening, the resulting drop in supraglottal pressure happens faster than the preceding rise. It is this pressure change (from high to low) that propagates through the vocal tract, setting that air mass into motion. I will refer to this pressure drop as an impulse, and it is acoustically like the sudden change in pressure that generates the sound of a handclap or the sound of a popped balloon. As the folds are in contact at this moment, the response of the vocal tract remains stronger for longer than if the vocal folds had been open. For readers accustomed to conceptualizing the contribution of the vocal folds to phonation in terms of discrete harmonics‚Äîa tenet of the source- filter model‚Äîit may be difficult to reorganize this basic concept. However, the slower rise and faster fall of supraglottal pressure as the folds open</p>

<p>and then contact represents continuous and accelerating changes in pressure. This means that somewhere along that accelerating pressure curve, a wide range of frequencies (rates of pressure change) exist. Hence the vocal folds work with the vocal tract to generate a broadband (all frequencies) impulse in the supraglottal air mass. If this is counterintuitive, record the sound of a handclap with a closely placed microphone and view the result in a spectrogram. That impulse similarly shows energy from very low to very high frequencies. Like a length of PVC pipe responding to a sudden slap at one end or a reverberant room responding to the pop of a balloon‚Äîacoustically if not aerodynamically‚Äîthe vocal tract reshapes this broadband impulse by the means of its own standing resonant modes of vibration.2 Another way to say this is that the air mass in the vocal tract is best able to move at certain speeds, based on its shape. The frequency ranges (rates of change in pressure) from the source impulse that coincide with those vocal tract resonances oscillate in pressure over time with greater strength than those that misalign. Frequency regions that misalign are quickly attenuated. What was a simple, repeating slow rise and fast fall in pressure facilitated by the modulation of transglottal air by the vocal folds becomes a substantially more complex pattern with multiple rises and falls in pressure of varying amplitudes. We might even say that the tube and the reverberant room change the timbre of each broadband impulse by allowing certain patterns and speeds of pressure change to ring for longer (continue to oscillate) than others. Here is another way to think about this: The vocal tract reflects the energy of that broadband source impulse at various changes in diameter along its length. These reflections all interfere with one another, both constructively and destructively. Some frequency regions (rates of change) are allowed to continue oscillating, while others are quickly attenuated. The total set of vocal tract resonances emerge as the sum of this complex cascade of interacting reflections within the vocal tract.3 Hence there is no single location in the vocal tract that is the source of a given resonance. The frequency ranges that survive this total wave</p>

<p>interference‚Äîwhich we see as formants in a spectrum‚Äîemerge from the initial pressure wave as it decays. If we sit with this idea for a moment, it may occur to you that the filter portion of the source-filter model may do more than filter the source. Does a wall filter the sound of a handclap when it produces an echo, or does the wall make a copy of that pressure wave and change it consistent with the acoustical properties of the wall? Stand in a corner facing into a room and you will notice that the reflections of your voice off the walls provide a strong boost in both warmth and intensity. Did these walls not add their own reflections to your direct sound, generating a new sound augmented by the additional sound sources? And if the vocal tract produces a cascade of reflections to the source impulse, are those not new pressure waves? Put another way, is the vocal tract itself a sound source, albeit one that requires input to function? Heller (2013) goes so far as to suggest: The source-filter idea is technically wrong, as long as you think of a filter as something that removes things, but it persists legitimately as a model. It seems a shame, however, to deprive singers and speakers of the notion of resonance, and instead leave them with the flat-footed impression that they are merely filtering whatever their vocal folds put out.4 Indeed, we may think of the vocal tract as a grouping of individual resonances, and one can dependably effect change in just a portion of the radiated spectrum through specific articulatory manipulations.5 Brad Story (2019) suggests that the entire vocal tract does appear to act on the entire source broadband impulse, although he frames it in spectral terms.6 When this pattern of impulse and resonance decay repeats periodically, as is found in a singing voice, pitch is layered onto timbre (more on this in chapter 5). Before the second impulse interferes with the resonant decay of the first, and the third similarly of the second, the source impulse theoretically contains the potential for much lower frequency (slower oscillations) information than most singers could sing as a pitch. It is the</p>

<p>repetition of the source impulse that filters out information that unfolds slower than the duration of the period, disallowing lower frequency information from emerging (see chapter 6 for a more thorough exploration of this concept). It seems credible to think of the transformation of the source signal by the vocal tract as the transformation of a broadband impulse generated by asymmetrical oscillations of airflow into a complex pressure wave that takes place per period of voicing. Note that viewing resonance as a function of time within a glottal cycle will ultimately sidestep the idea that all the harmonics shown in a spectrum persistently exist at all timescales. The reshaped (complex) pressure wave radiated from the singer is further transformed by the acoustical properties of the room (and the signal chain if the singing is amplified),7 the listener‚Äôs body, their pinnae, and their ear canals.8 Once the energy of this complex wave is transferred from the last line of air molecules in the ear canal to the eardrum, the physical limitations of the middle and inner ear come into play. What we have just explored here is different from common acoustical models in voice pedagogy, which suggest the interaction of voice source harmonics and vocal tract resonances.9 To be clear, no physicist or acoustician would likely suggest that this harmonic model is strictly accurate. But my long participation in the science-informed voice pedagogy community tells me that this is how many singers and many voice teachers think. Admittedly, this model is heuristic and helpful; however, it risks profoundly distorting our sense of how the system works. Even still, every step of this process can be understood through the lens of a Fourier transform, which appears to imply the opposite: that the vocal folds create a periodic source sound independent of the resonator, that this source sound can be understood as a buzzing sawtooth wave, and that that physical phenomenon is equivalent to a spectrum of distinct harmonics.10 This widely accepted and broadly taught model appears to imply that the signal fed into the vocal tract is a set of separate harmonics that interact independently with similarly independent vocal tract resonances.</p>

<p>If we believe that the complex, physical wave generated by a voice is a collection of harmonic pure tones‚Äîwhich is what a spectrum at least initially appears to show‚Äîthen to operate within this model we must also mismodel the ear as a system capable of receiving that input. As I will explore below, the ear cannot do this. Ultimately the physical wave generated by the voice is a complex pattern of pressure changes that move through space over time, regardless of how one might mathematically summarize it. Since this is so, it follows that every implementation of this harmonic model in the voice pedagogy literature is at least partially incomplete. Correspondingly, the way that voice acoustics is taught in the voice pedagogy classroom, the way that modern voice educators disseminate this information online, and the way that well- intentioned voice teachers try to implement these concepts in the studio all may suffer from this framing. By contrast, the source-filter model of speech production rests on the notion that this is a reasonable way to conceptualize the system.11 And it is a remarkably useful model. It is true that at any point in the physical process of voicing explained above, one could impose a Fourier transform on the signal and consider the pressure wave according to its spectral components. However, this does not mean that a spectral analysis captures either the physical nature of the phenomenon at a given moment, or that all it reveals are perceptually relevant structures. I posit that this is a good example of an overlooked distinction: Voice pedagogy texts present a reasonable way to model discrete parts of the voice, but these well-meant efforts risk centering an incomplete description of how the voice works. We can think of the sound of the oscillating vocal folds sans vocal tract; with a cadaver larynx and an air compressor, we can actually record that sound, which does sound like a buzzing sawtooth wave‚Äîa sound with a complete spectrum of harmonics that drop in intensity the higher in the spectrum one looks.12 But that sidesteps the fact that each individual impulse of energy arising from the closing cadaver folds excites the unbound air above the excised larynx per glottal cycle. There is no vocal tract in this experiment. And many different periodically repeated patterns will generate a spectrum of</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<p>harmonics when passed through a Fourier transform. In other words, this experiment does not demonstrate that the vocal folds generate harmonics when connected to a vocal tract. It demonstrates that they produce a periodic pattern that can be analyzed in terms of harmonics, even without a vocal tract. In vivo, the sound generated by an excised larynx never actually exists as a repeated phenomenon. It is always coupled with the vocal tract. We can think of the effect of the vocal tract in terms of what would have to interface with each individual source harmonic. But that would require that we conform the physical behavior of the vocal tract to accommodate this specific model of the input itself. Finally, we could assume that the images that commonly configured spectra and spectrograms show‚Äîwith discrete harmonics and formant peaks‚Äîaccurately represent the way in which we perceive a voice. But this ignores the transformative power of the ear.</p>
