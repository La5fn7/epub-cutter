<p>that still aligns with the period of 1f o and exhibits little damping within that period, whether or not that formant rises to the percept of an overtone. This resonance strategy can be found across genres. Singers typically use this strategy on high-energy, higher-pitched ‚Äúmoney‚Äù notes. In a spectrum, we typically see a strong 2f o or 3f o (or possibly 4f o or 5f o), and the percept of the vowel simplifies in a characteristic way. The above approaches to navigating higher pitches all feature strong acoustic energy oscillating within the vocal tract. These oscillations have timbral qualities determined at least in part by the tone colors of those strong standing waves. To refresh your memory regarding overtone singing, you can refer to chapter 6. In the following two sections I will discuss the second and third approaches shown above. The Tone Color of a Strong 1f o: Solutions for the Treble Staff and Higher Classical treble singers and many contemporary singers with a warm sound commonly generate a strong first formant that coincides with 1f o on and above the treble staff. This favors the warmer, pure regions of the spectrum, which both contributes to the timbre and creates a resonance potentially strong enough to act as a driving force for phonation. Or at least a potential driving force that assists the generation of the supraglottal impulse. The degree of such nonlinearity is related to the amplitude of oscillation of that resonance. I will explore examples from two classical singers here, but go listen to the first 1:08 of Whitney Houston‚Äôs recording of ‚ÄúI Will Always Love You.‚Äù11 She features a persistent 1f o throughout, which contributes a pure |~u| quality</p>

<p>regardless of the vowel. More on the hazards of studying commercial recordings in the next section. Vowels with a lower first resonance (f R1) such as [u] and [i] will exhibit this alignment strongly toward the bottom of the treble staff. Vowels with a higher f R1 will find corresponding alignment toward the top of the treble staff. It is important to know that these approaches all feature a strong and pure percept, but that they sound different based on the tone color of their first formant (F 1). This is a reminder that the tone color of a strong first resonance (f R1) that is aligned with the fundamental (1f o) moves through |~u| and |~o| as it ascends the treble staff, followed in its ascent by |~…î|, |~…ë|, and |~a| in the octave between F5 (~698 Hz) and F6 (~1397 Hz). Above that, the fundamental of any sung sound is both extremely simple and sounds significantly |~√¶| in tone color. Technically it is possible to sing 1f o into the |~e| and |~i| ASTC ranges, but that is just below and in the seventh octave. These tone colors do not exclusively form the overall vowel percept at any of these pitches. But they will be significant contributors. Note too that even if the first resonance of an [a], for example, is aligned with 2f o when singing the pitch F4, the tone color of that now quieter 1f o remains a less pronounced |~u|. There is no one accepted practice for singing the low f R1 vowels toward the top of the treble staff or the high f R1 vowels toward the bottom of the treble staff. Much remains up to the aesthetic targets of the singer in these cases. I have found that the need to meticulously tune resonances based on pitch is obviated once issues related to breathing and airflow, vocal fold adduction, and basic vocal tract shape are addressed. This resonance strategy is, like the others I will cover below, an emergent property of loud, efficient singing. It is not a quick fix that solves other technical challenges. In figure 10.6 you will find two different examples of whoop or hoot, which is the abovementioned alignment of the slowest vocal tract resonance (f R1) with the fundamental (1f o) to generate a high-intensity, perceptually pure F 1. Figure 10.6 shows waveforms and spectra of a soprano singing an [a] at the pitch C6 (top), and a countertenor singing</p>

<p>an [i] at the pitch E4 (bottom). Note that for each pitch period, both waveforms feature a single slow ripple from low to high pressure, and back again to low. Three periods of each sample are shown, and the approximate start of the second and third period is marked with a dashed line. Note the difference in timescale as the C6 has a significantly shorter pitch period. Figure 10.6 Waveforms (left) and spectra (right) of C6 sung by a classical soprano (top) and E4 (bottom) sung by a classical countertenor (note different timescale). Vertical lines in waveforms indicate estimated start of each period. Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. We can start to predict the perceptual differences between these two sounds by comparing the waveforms and spectra. Both spectra in figure 10.6 are dominated by 1f o. This is how the Fourier transform displays that slowest ripple in the waveform in a spectrum or spectrogram, regardless of the frequency. However, the soprano‚Äôs waveform and spectrum are both visibly simpler than the countertenor‚Äôs waveform and spectrum. The countertenor sample has additional, faster resonances</p>
