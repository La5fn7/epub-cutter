<p>This works very well, especially at lower dynamics. One may also phonate while attempting to push the abdomen out. However, biomechanically this will most likely cause the rib cage to fall. Pushing the abdomen out either directly couples abdominal engagement and vocal fold adduction, which risks pressing, or demands that muscular effort manage rib cage expansion. This works, but it does not do so particularly efficiently. If you would like to read more about the relationship between abdominal and rib cage circumferences in respiration, this has been explored in some detail in the research literature. I encourage those who are interested to explore this endnote.7 Phonation and Resonation In the most rudimentary sense, phonation occurs because tracheal pressure overcomes the resistance of adducted vocal folds. Once set into motion, this process self-sustains until either the tracheal pressure falls below a certain threshold or the vocal folds abduct. How much more detail you would like to bring to your understanding of this process likely relates to what you want to do with this information. The scientific literature has zoomed into minute aspects of tissue histology and airflow patterns. This level of detail is likely not immediately necessary to understand the various functional options available to a singer. Just a gentle reminder that as deeply as you think you understand singing, someone has already gone much deeper.8 I group phonation and resonation together because I do not believe it is productive to separate them. It is common to imagine that the oscillation of the vocal folds generates an acoustic signal‚Äî the ‚Äúsource‚Äù‚Äîthat is subsequently filtered by the vocal tract‚Äîthe ‚Äúfilter.‚Äù I have argued throughout previous chapters that we may do better to consider that the rapid change in pressure of the</p>

<p>supraglottal air mass per glottal cycle is the ‚Äúsource‚Äù of the voice. This pressure change is the event that instigates or perpetuates the resonant response of the vocal tract. This instigation literally happens in the vocal tract, not in the vocal fold tissue. Instead, the vocal folds act on the air that flows between them and, in doing so, have a profound effect on that supraglottal pressure change. It is in this spirit that I will offer a narrative to describe the process of phonation and resonation, supported by commentary that outlines pedagogically actionable conclusions and perceptual correlates. Once the process of respiration has compressed the air in the lungs in some manner, the tracheal pressure will rise. With sufficiently adducted vocal folds, this pressure will exceed the phonation threshold pressure, pushing the vocal folds apart. This is true if starting from complete adduction of the vocal folds, but it is also true if the folds are in a more abducted posture likely to generate a breathy sound. This remains true even if attempting to drive oscillation of only the false vocal folds, a choice that has traditionally been most common in growl or distortion techniques. The displacement of the adducted vocal fold tissue occurs from bottom to top. There may also be an anterior to posterior pattern of displacement, but we will ignore that for now. Depending on how adducted the vocal folds are, the phonation threshold pressure may be high. Depending on registration, more vocal fold tissue may be in the way from bottom to top. As the tracheal pressure starts to push the vocal fold tissue out of the way, that tissue traces a lateral path from the midline of the glottis out to its maximum place of excursion and then back toward the midline. The ability of tracheal pressure to overcome vocal fold adduction is a primary driving force for vocal fold opening in self-sustaining oscillation. I hope this builds some intuition that the nature of vocal fold adduction, the depth of vocal fold contact, and the vocal fold tissue, tone, and composition will all impact the necessary range of tracheal pressure. This means that</p>

<p>pitch, loudness, and timbre all affect and are affected by tracheal pressure. Once the vocal folds allow air to flow between them (transglottal flow), the pressure regimes below, within, and above the glottis all start to shift. The vocal fold tissue returns from its maximum excursion back to the midline largely because of the release of elastic recoil energy stored in that tissue as they opened. Again, we find a subsystem that reacts to the way in which it receives energy, stores, and then releases that energy according to its own properties. This suggests that the return from the maximum excursion to the midline slows down as that elastic recoil energy is spent. Toward the end of this return path, the pressure between the folds drops, facilitating an acceleration in the contacting speed of the vocal folds, and the contacting wave ripples from bottom to top of the vocal fold tissue. At the moment of contact the tracheal pressure spikes as the supraglottal pressure drops. Depending on the depth of vocal fold contact, the underside (inferior) edge of the folds is both parted first while the superior tissue remains adducted and also starts its return journey back to midline first. This is an additional asymmetry that suggests that the deeper the vocal fold contacting surface, the faster the cessation of transglottal airflow relative to its instigation. This asymmetrical airflow pattern‚Äîa slower rise in flow followed by a faster cessation of flow‚Äîhelps to shape the flow pattern of the ‚Äúnew‚Äù air entering the vocal tract. Recall our earlier exercise stimulating a low pitch on a loud [a]. I suggested that this stimulus will automatically shorten your thyroarytenoids, facilitating a loose mucosal cover and releasing strain on the vocal ligament. The vocal folds will make deeper contact. Inhalation and tracheal pressure will adjust for this sound. The sound will likely gain auditory roughness and some pitch-less noise, and the formants‚Äîall faster than the rate of vocal fold oscillation‚Äîwill exhibit much complexity. That stimulus</p>

<p>then also generates a flow pattern with a slow rise in flow and a much faster cessation of that flow as the thyroarytenoid muscle engagement pushes the inferior portion of each vocal fold to midline and the loose mucosal cover freely moves over the deeper muscle. How high the flow rate rises depends in part on the degree of muscular adduction of the vocal folds. This suggests that a deep breath may‚Äîall other things being equal‚Äîultimately allow more air to flow through the glottis every glottal cycle because the vocal folds will un-press a little at baseline. Look back to figure 7.8 in chapter 7 and remember that features of robust flow phonation include higher rates of airflow overall and a faster cessation of that airflow per glottal cycle. It may seem odd to imagine that this robust sound could be generated by vocal folds that are not adducted as much as possible. Common sense tells us that more effort should produce more power. And in a linear system it likely would. Consider, though, that the kind of vocal fold posture described here allows the loose mucosal cover to slide around as it oscillates. Because the mucosal cover has a wider excursion than more aggressively adducted vocal folds, the elastic recoil of that tissue easily travels to the midline with the bottom-to-top asymmetry, achieving complete closure while transferring more air to the vocal tract and shutting off that airflow more quickly. In this way, shorter vocal folds with a loose cover feature a characteristic rotational motion. The result is a heavier registration with a more robust sound characterized by both warmth (the slower aspects of the airflow) and buzzy brightness (the faster aspects of the subsequent drop in supraglottal pressure). When the vocal folds are stretched to sing higher pitches, all of these dynamics shift. Remember stimulating our high pitch (below around A4) on a quiet [u] from earlier. I suggested that this stimulus would decrease the engagement of your thyroarytenoid muscles, stretch your vocal folds with your cricothyroid muscles, and hand</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<p>over the mucosal wave of self-sustaining vocal fold oscillation from the slack cover riding over the stiff fibers of your thyroarytenoids to the now stiffer vocal ligament. Your vocal fold contacting area will decrease, especially in the bottom-to-top (inferior-to-superior) dimension. This means that the rotational motion lessens as the depth of vocal fold contact decreases, and the tracheal pressure must rise to move stiffer vocal folds. Taken together, this means that the difference between the rate of accelerating the air through the glottis and how fast that airflow drops becomes more sinusoidal‚Äî more like mirror images of each other‚Äîalthough it will always be skewed to some extent. This is because the difference in timing between the superior and inferior edges of the vocal folds decreases. The underside of the vocal folds no longer interrupts the process as quickly. It may seem counterintuitive that this adjustment ultimately generates a sound with less auditory roughness, less pitch-less noise, and with simpler sounding formants. Tissue vibrating under greater tension should make a brighter, louder sound. But it is the effect of the tissue on the air itself that generates the sound. We have to consider that the slower cessation of airflow results in slower rates of change in the supraglottal air mass. Let us now turn our attention to other aspects of the role of the larynx in phonation. The posterior ends of the vocal folds attach to the movable arytenoid cartilages. These cartilages may move in several ways, and they are responsible for both opening the vocal folds while breathing and drawing them together while phonating. They may completely close the posterior end of the vocal folds, facilitating complete closure every glottal cycle. They may partially close, allowing some airflow as the vocal folds contact. These are continuously adjustable structures. Stimulate a breathy sound and the arytenoid cartilages will move away from midline to partially open the vocal folds. Stimulate a</p>

<p>glottal onset (for example, a /…°a/), and they will fully close before you phonate. As with other laryngeal structures, they respond to stimuli. Additionally, the role of the thyroarytenoid muscles in adduction can be significant. When fully engaged, these muscles bulge toward the midline, facilitating complete, deep closure of the vocal folds per glottal cycle. This can generate imbalances if those contracted muscles resist the stretching required to sing higher pitches, rather than gradually releasing as pitch rises. Cracks can occur when those muscles suddenly release, but the sound is typically bright, rough, and loud right up to the crack. As mentioned in the respiration section above, the basic position of the larynx can affect the ability of these structures to move, and, as I will explore now, the shape of the vocal tract can have a strong effect on the flow pulses the vocal folds facilitate. It is easy to build models based on the parts of a system we can see. Because the larynx is a physical structure, registration models have traditionally been framed around how that structure changes. The tongue and the other articulators are also physical structures, and they affect the sound based on their positions and motions. However, the sound is a result of the behavior of the air itself. The larynx is interesting insomuch as it modulates airflow. The vocal tract and the various articulators are interesting insomuch as they alter the behavior of the air in the vocal tract. The patterns of pressure change in the air are what reach our ears. In a very real way, the voice is the air. Thus, as we explored with phonation above, we need to understand how the vocal tract affects the behavior of the air it contains. From the vocal tract‚Äôs point of view, the flow of air into the vocal tract is not welcome. The vocal tract is already full of air that is reluctant to move, especially at the velocities of phonation. New air increases the density‚Äîand therefore pressure‚Äîof the supraglottal air mass. This might seem paradoxical, but the air used for</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 310</h3>

<p>phonation does not flow directly out of the mouth. It bunches up when it enters the vocal tract. This creates a plane of higher- pressure air as the rate of transglottal airflow increases. As the flow overcomes the resistance of that air mass, the higher-pressure plane moves forward in the vocal tract. When the vocal folds partially or completely shut off that flow, the space between the vocal folds and the high-pressure region suddenly drops in density. A drop in density is a drop in pressure. Because the transglottal airflow pattern is asymmetrical, the pressure drops in the supraglottal air mass faster than it rose. Hypothetically, if we were limited to generating sound powered only by the positive pressure generated by the flow, we would make neither bright nor particularly loud sounds. We cannot directly accelerate a change in air pressure fast enough. The response of the air itself, however, is very fast indeed. Displaced air molecules will swing back toward their equilibrium position quickly. Thus, the faster the cessation of airflow, the faster the supraglottal air mass will drop from high to low pressure, because that step involves no muscles or tissue: It is a property of the air itself. As covered in chapter 3, it is this change in the pressure of the supraglottal air mass that excites the rest of the air in the vocal tract. As this change from high to low pressure occurs in a continuous fashion, continuous rates of change in air pressure characterize that curve. We can understand this ‚Äúsource‚Äù as a broadband impulse with elements of slow and fast pressure changes. We hear those rates of change as dark and bright. How resistant the air mass is to the flow depends on several factors. Air in a contained space behaves differently than unbounded air. Air bounded by hard surfaces behaves differently than air bounded by soft, acoustically absorbent surfaces. In simple terms: The smaller the container, the stiffer the air, and the faster its own elastic recoil properties will respond. The harder the walls of the container,</p>

<p>the longer the duration of the resulting oscillation. I have referred to this as ‚Äúdamping‚Äù throughout this book. Thus, brightness in the voice appears to relate to making some portion of the vocal tract just small enough‚Äîwhat colleagues of mine and I call beneficial narrowing. Ringing and resonant sounds appear to relate to making a part of the vocal tract harder that was softer. Recall the resonance strategies covered in chapter 10. I doubt that Bareilles, Corelli, Pasquale, or Hampson softened their tongues or pharyngeal walls to produce those cutting sounds. Or consider approaches to overtone singing as introduced in chapter 6. Practitioners of overtone singing understand that it is the tone of the tongue muscles as much as the position in the mouth that helps generate that strong resonance. Here are two practical ways to think through this: (1) The tongue is generally not useful for singing when completely relaxed. This is an article of faith to some. However, I think it is demonstrable that some approaches to singing benefit from a slightly firm tongue. (2) You can sequence where in the vocal tract the beneficial narrowing falls and, based on the sound, can verify the behavior of potential vocal tract narrowing that you cannot see. If the narrowing is as far forward as possible at the lips‚Äîlike a dark [u] or straw phonation‚Äîthat means the entire air mass from the vocal folds to that constriction point can all pick up a little of the slack from the flow. This is a very warm sound with little to no buzziness or noise, at least relative to more-open sounds. The vocal tract does not strongly fight the transglottal flow, so the entire air mass can act as a long shock absorber. This is so dependably true that you can tease out whether you are unintentionally narrowing further upstream. A buzzy quality on this sound means you are making an additional narrowing further back in the pharynx. If the narrowing is with the tongue dorsum, you will hear a clear vowel sound; [i], [e], and [√¶] demonstrate this well. This sound can have both warmth from the transglottal flow and brightness from the</p>

<p>beneficial narrowing of the tongue against the roof of the mouth. This sound characterizes a neutral ‚Äúhome base‚Äù for many popular- styles singers, and it offers a lot of flexibility regarding registration. To identify whether the tongue is the only actor, stick it out of the mouth and sing. If the sound is still bright and buzzy, the narrowing is further upstream in the pharynx. If the sound is dull with the tongue out and transitions to a clear sound as the tongue returns to its position in the mouth, you have found the right amount of effort to leverage this narrowing. If you again think of the vocal tract air mass as a shock absorber, it is now shorter and springs back faster. It is also possible to narrow more than one part of the pharynx. A humming sound with buzzy brightness, for example, employs pharyngeal narrowing. The nose itself generates a dopey and dull sound as a resonator rather than a bright and edgy sound. This kind of pharyngeal narrowing is common in character voices and in some musical theater aesthetics. Think Kristin Chenoweth. Kerrie Obert associates this pharyngeal narrowing function (irrespective of nasal airflow) with lateral to medial (sides to the middle) narrowing, and it may encourage vocal fold adduction.9 It is characterized by its lack of warmth and its abundance of buzziness and noise. This suggests that a smaller amount of air passes through the glottis every cycle, but the cessation of airflow is rapid. It is also possible to decrease the aperture of the supraglottal space to stiffen the air mass that the transglottal flow encounters. This tends to generate a cutting, ringing sound with both warmth and buzzy brightness. Previously it was thought that a sphincter muscle narrowed the aryepiglottic fold. More recent work by Obert points to the role of the vallecula (a small empty space in the pharynx anterior to the epiglottis) as an antiresonance that can be mitigated by the action of the tongue root.10 She labels this anterior- to-posterior narrowing (front-to-back).
