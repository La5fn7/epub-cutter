<p>WHAT IF FORMANTS HAVE TONE COLORS? In 2013 I was a doctoral student working with the composer and music theorist Robert Cogan at the New England Conservatory. He was an early adopter of spectrograms in the analysis of structural design within music. His own work, influenced by generations of composers, focused on timbre as a compositional parameter in music31 and extended older ideas about tone color32 into the (then) modern age of computer-based spectral analysis. Cogan thought in terms of two structural levels of tone color: First, that all frequencies (from low to high) may be grouped into grave, neutral, and acute colors.33 Second, within those divisions lie subqualities evocative of several vowels. Figure 8.1 illustrates this substructure, moving from the grave [u] and [o] into the neutral [a] and finally acute [e] and [i]. Figure 8.1 Robert Cogan&#x27;s register-based analysis of the ‚Äúsonic qualities‚Äù of sine waves. Source: A new schematic by the author based on Robert Cogan, New Images of Musical Sounds, pages 7, 12. Note that Cogan uses these labels to group large swaths of frequencies, and that changes take place consistent with octaves starting on the pitch class C. This is a rough shorthand intended to allow a moderately granular analysis of timbre. While I do not think the fine details of this scheme hold up to scrutiny‚Äîfor example, the strongest</p>

<p>vowel formant for [u] falls within the frequency range that Cogan suggests evokes an [o]-like color‚ÄîI do want to assert that the concept being conveyed is important. As I was exposed to these ideas, I was simultaneously immersed in a study of Donald G. Miller‚Äôs book Resonance in Singing (2008). This seminal text in the application of acoustic theory and computer-based visual feedback to the act of singing is remarkably thorough in contextualizing the parameters of voicing investigated. It is notably devoid of detailed perceptual descriptions of sound beyond a single occurrence of the word dullness to describe a lack of second formant tuning in a tenor voice;34 and the words dark and darkness to describe 1f o : f R1 tuning of an endogenous estrogen puberty classical singer on the pitch F4.35 Viewing Miller‚Äôs book through the lens of Cogan‚Äôs work suggests that while Miller repeatedly discusses the effect of a given formant tuning maneuver or effective closed quotient (now referred to as ‚Äúcontact quotient‚Äù) on a singing voice, he does not discuss changes in the resulting sound with any granularity. He characterizes the quantitative acoustic output of singing but does not discuss how the ear is likely to respond to that output. In fact, he frequently conveys certain ideas by contrasting two differing sound samples. I think these explorations would be complemented by the simple, and fundamentally uncontroversial, two- timbre model introduced in chapter 7. Consider two acoustical relationships that Miller points to: Hoot and Yell. Hoot, Miller‚Äôs term for aligning the frequency of vocal fold oscillation with every oscillation of the slowest resonance (1f o : f R1), does not just create a fundamental dominant spectrum with a low effective contact quotient.36 Hoot is characterized by the purity and strength of resolved harmonics and frequently lacks the buzz of auditory roughness at higher pitches. Yell, Miller‚Äôs term for aligning the frequency of vocal fold oscillation with every other cycle of the slowest resonance (2f o : f R1), is not just the strength of the second harmonic in the spectrum and a higher effective contact quotient.37 It is typically characterized by the brightness and buzziness of the resulting higher‚Äëfrequency, unresolved energy.</p>

<p>I was particularly fascinated by the horizontal, between-vowels, listening implications of Cogan‚Äôs work‚Äîthat a pressure pattern in a given frequency range elicits a certain timbral response regardless of the source, and that this is a tool composers and performers can use to generate structure and meaning in music. Every serious voice pedagogy text that addresses acoustics thoroughly explores the idea that different vowels share formants in common.38 For example, I knew from that literature that the vowels [i] and [u] tend to have a similar first formant frequency. I had never seen that concept connected to the idea that those shared formants should sound similar between those vowels. In fact, much of the literature seemed to suggest the opposite: that vowels were the irreducible simultaneous presence of their entire formant structure. What might it mean if a spectral feature common to two vowels produces a similar tone color percept? Figure 8.2 illustrates the first proof of this concept that I explored. I chose two vowels with a common first formant in a range that allowed me to sing f R1 ‚âà 1f o on a [u] and an [i]. This aligned a single harmonic with the first resonance in each vowel, making it more likely that the resulting spectral structures would be the same.</p>

A long-term average spectrum for the first [u] is shown in black and [i] in gray. Notice the nearly identical power of 1f o in both vowels. Source: Recorded by author under controlled condtions. When I pass-filtered 1f o , it was impossible to distinguish the [u] from the [i]. There was no tone color transition between the vowels. Repeated blind tests on students and colleagues produced similar results. When asked which vowel the pass-filtered fundamental sounded the most like,</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 204</h3>

<p>the answer was invariably [u] rather than [i]. When I reintroduced the rest of the spectrum, the [i] could be heard as a separate color rising above an ever-present [u]-like quality. The spectral feature on the screen had a real-world perceptual correlate. It appeared to be both demonstrable and dependable. See Lab #14. This experience challenges a few long-established ideas. I learned from voice pedagogy texts that vowels are the result of the entire set of formants at once, especially the lowest two. This narrative simplifies the explanation for why two different vowels might share a common formant. If it is the presence of energy at all of those frequencies at once, it would not matter if there were trivial similarities in just a portion of the spectrum. Another way to conceive of this is that vowel quality is equally imprinted across the spectrum. This leads to vowel modification strategies such as passing through a vowel sequence with increasingly faster first formant frequencies (for example, [u] ‚Üí [o] ‚Üí […î] ‚Üí [a] ‚Üí [√¶]) to avoid singing a pitch above the first formant of a given vowel on and above the treble staff. There is reasonable evidence to support the ‚Äúentire spectrum at once‚Äù hypothesis, as intelligibility of speech is not significantly degraded by filtering only a portion of the spectrum. With some limitations, it does not even matter which portion of the spectrum is filtered.39 This is a prime example of the tension between the intelligibility of speech (based on coarticulation and phonetic context) and the inherent timbre of a sound (based on the response of the ear to spectral and timing information). Though intelligibility may be preserved, the timbre changes radically when the pressure wave is changed in these filtering experiments. The timbre of a sung sound similarly changes when varying the vocal tract shape, registration, loudness, and emotional affect while aiming for a consistent phonetic target. See Lab # 15. The findings of these simple and easily repeated experiments suggest that the first formant of [i] might sound like [u]. That is to say, a strong, simple, vowel-defining formant in [u] becomes a secondary, coloring formant in [i]. Recall Vennard‚Äôs (1967) comment that ‚Äúwhen one sings Ee ([i]), he is really singing Oo ([u]), plus a still more ringing overtone.‚Äù40</p>

<p>This experiment suggests that Vennard‚Äôs framing of vowel formants may be more than a thought experiment. He may have been pointing directly to an actionable aspect of functional listening. This experiment‚Äîa loose implementation of the idea of tone color‚Äî also provides a cautionary example of how these ideas may be misunderstood. Framed in this way, one might easily counter that an isolated [u] and [i] are each complicated combinations of tone colors. The phoneme [u] contains additional, brighter tone colors and timbral qualities not captured by a pure tone at the pitch E4, even if the tone color of that fundamental is strongly [u]-like. The phoneme [i] is similarly complex and contains both vowel-defining and complementary tone colors at once. A stricter discussion of the concept of tone color would suggest that [u] and [i] are indeed complexes of varied colors. However, those variations may be parsed out. The percept that [u] and [i] share is not itself a vowel, even if it finds agreement with [u] more readily than [i]. It is a tone color. It is something that can be noticed, remembered, and anticipated. It is something that can be predicted to have buzziness or not, pitch or not. It is clearly simpler than a full spectrum, but it still elicits specific perceptual qualities that may be contrasted with other parts of each spectrum. How might this knowledge help voice teachers? Donald G. Miller (2008) suggests the utility of real-time spectrographic feedback because ‚Äúthe teacher‚Äôs experienced ear, unaided by objective measurement, has limited ability to determine whether formant tuning is actually taking place.‚Äù41 What is the nature of this limitation? Is it intrinsic to human hearing? Is it not possible to hear how different parts of a spectrum change as pitch and vowel change? Is the issue that we cannot hear what is seen on a spectrogram unaided? Or is the issue that the spectrogram displays information in a manner that does not readily reflect how a human perceives complex sounds? I argue that the ability to aurally parse out the consistent color of that shared first formant (the fundamental here) in both the [u] and [i] vowels offers an introduction to how we may ultimately resolve this limitation. Is a singer achieving a 1f o : f R1 coupling on an [i] vowel? If the teacher can</p>

<p>parse out the perceptual quality of 1f o (warm, pure, [u]-like in this case) from the rest of the spectrum, they may literally listen for it in real time.</p>
