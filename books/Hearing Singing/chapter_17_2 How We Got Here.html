<p>2 How We Got Here Evidence-based voice pedagogy is a broad and ever-expanding field. Scientific studies slowly accumulate generally held knowledge about the voice. We also gather information from the lived experience of voice educators, and from the ongoing practice of exploring the limits of human voice production through singing.1 Those working in the voice pedagogy industry have a sense that more is knowable‚Äî and that there are more ways of knowing‚Äîthan any one person can fully grasp. Whether an idea is interesting, important, actionable, practical, or even applicable is frequently unclear, even after some passage of time. This means that much of the literature now under the umbrella of voice pedagogy rests on ideas that seem to be true and important, but that may or may not connect well to the real act of singing. Vennard (1949) explicitly makes the argument for this approach in the first paragraph of his preface to Singing: the Mechanism and the Technic: [This book] . . . is an attempt to compile under one cover objective findings from various reliable sources and to relate them to the art of singing. There are those teachers who feel that applying science to an art is quackery, but I believe</p>

<p>that our only safeguard against the charlatan is general knowledge of the most accurate information available. . . . The knowledge of literal facts is the only justifiable basis for the use of imagery and other indirect methods.2 This implies that the opposite of charlatanism is to ground teaching in scientific fact. However, this risks missing that (1) scientists create their conceptual models by reducing information in ways that are typically best suited to the ends of the scientific community, and (2) that scientific models are limited by the kinds of singing studied. These simplified models can, in turn, risk implying that the ultimate value lies in knowing the fact rather than applying the principle. If greater exposure to information is an automatic good, we should be living in a golden age of voice teaching. Modern communication platforms now make it easy for anyone to share their take on voice pedagogy. One popular approach is to acknowledge the existence of a science-derived concept, further simplify and repackage it, and offer sound bites ready for the consumer. These layered simplifications are generally based on other, already simplified models, themselves used to further simplify and explain something even more complex. Such takeaways frequently reinforce the details of the model and do not meaningfully map to aspects of the underlying reality. This creates a bizarre paradigm where we may conceptualize the physical reality of voice production as though a scientific model is the starting point, rather than a summary of a complex, multistep analytical process. And this problematic process can still demand work on our part, creating a sense that we have learned something. This is not a promising map to navigate in the twenty-first century. Well-curated information risks limited applicability across various ways of singing. More widely available information risks</p>
