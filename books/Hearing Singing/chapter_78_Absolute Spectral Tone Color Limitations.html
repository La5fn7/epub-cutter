<p>ABSOLUTE SPECTRAL TONE COLOR: LIMITATIONS Why use vowel symbols as labels? This is a question I have struggled with. Remember that the tone colors of pure tones have historically been challenging to label outside the use of vowel names. Vowels are how humans appear to think about tone color. Ask a child to imitate the coo of a mourning dove and they will intuitively make a lip-rounded [u] shape. Ask them to imitate the bleat of a sheep and they will shape laterally for [√¶]. Ask them to make the squealing sound of wet city bus brakes and they will screech a thin [i] sound. We imitate the sound of an ambulance siren with wheeooowheeoo [wijuwijuwiju]. We all seem to understand on a deep level that certain vowels, as objective sounds outside of their semantic function in language, are characterized by certain tone colors. We all seem to use vowels to generate spectra that imitate sounds that share the same tone colors, despite not being generated by a human voice. Even yet, to use a vowel label in this work, even when qualified with softening language such as vowel-like, is to invite critique. It is easy to assume that those vowel labels imply that a simple sound characterizes the complete timbral quality of the vowel percept it references. This argument has been ongoing for more than a century. Stepping to the side of such arguments, I want to qualify ASTC. First, it is important to reiterate that the tone colors of pure tones are only similar to the defining quality of the chosen vowel; they are vowel-like. Actual vowels are complex combinations of many different tone colors and other time- variant and time-invariant aspects of timbre. It should be obvious to anyone that a pure tone will never fully represent that sound. Second, although the separate ASTC regions labeled in figure 9.1 indicate frequency regions of similar vowel-like tone colors, even the tone colors within each range lie on a continuous spectrum. The vowel-like tone color on the border between two ranges will share an affinity with both, much like the transitions between dominant colors in a rainbow.</p>

<p>The simplest notation for an ASTC label is to place a tilde (~) before the corresponding IPA symbol. For example, the ASTC of a simple sound with a frequency of the pitch D4 is ~u. The tilde conveys like or approximately the defining tone color of [u]. More formally, these ASTC symbols may then be set apart from surrounding text with pipes (also called vertical bars or vertical lines). This follows the convention of the International Phonetic Alphabet, which uses punctuation (usually solidi or square brackets) to parenthesize its symbols. Visually, these pipes look identical to the absolute-value brackets used in mathematics, which aligns with the concept. The tone color of a pure tone at the pitch D4 may then be notated as |~u|. If you are aware of the order of second formant (F 2) frequencies for the vowel labels I use, you will notice that the chart in figure 9.1 follows that pattern with the general exception of |~u| and |~o|. I write ‚Äúgeneral‚Äù because one could certainly close and round a [u] or an [o] to the point that both formants fell below the average values for that vowel. But in many cases, these vowels are strongly defined by the tone color of the first formant (F 1), while the second formant (F 2) provides a weaker, brighter complementary tone color. To someone committed to the notion that the entire formant structure defines the entire vowel, this may seem like a suspiciously unsupported parsing of the spectrum. However, it is easily demonstrated that the second formant (F 2) is the most highly variable formant among vowels (see figure 9.2). If you think about formant contributions in these terms, it should at least pique your curiosity as to whether the second formant (F 2) carries much of the burden of vowel identity. Or, put another way, how much of the vowel- defining tone color of the spectrum is strongly characterized by the second formant? Removing that second formant may not obliterate intelligibility, given the integral role of coarticulation in language cognition. However, removing F 2 definitely changes the timbre in a more radical way relative to removing any other formant (with the likely aforementioned exceptions of [u] and [o]). See Lab #18.</p>

<p>Figure 9.2 Spectrogram of [u], [o], [a], [e], [i] showing the first and second formants. Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. I bring two obvious biases to this schema: (1) I limit the frequency range worth labeling to reflect the potential range of vowel formants in the human voice. Acknowledging our vocologist and voice science colleagues who study nonhuman subjects, I am sure that tone color varies in meaningful ways below (slower than) |~u| and above (faster than) |~bright i| for other animals. I suspect that bats, mice, rats, and other animals capable of very high-frequency communication may perceive differences in a range that a human would never hear, let alone differentiate from the brightest |~i| imaginable. If we could produce a strong vowel formant lower than the F 1 of [u], I can imagine an inventory of additional, darker vowels experienced by some other creature. Therefore, the ASTC scale is strongly anthropomorphized. (2) While the sounds associated with specific IPA labels do vary between languages, I have limited these labels to a subset of familiar vowel sounds that occur in English. I would expect non-English speakers to subtly prioritize other labels where they are spectrally relevant. For example, a native German or French speaker may argue that |~y| has a place in or around where an English speaker finds the transition between</p>

<p>|~e| and |~i|, because they are familiar with the strong spectral energy that exists in [y] in the space between and around the second major spectral peaks of [e] and [i]. ASTC holds, regardless of how one confronts the tone color differences between these peaks, because all that matters is that one would consistently use the same label when comparing a pure tone to a novel pure tone of the same frequency. Even if a non-English speaker would argue for slightly different borders for these ASTC symbols, I am confident that they would do so consistently.11 The ASTC framework then does not depend on the agreement between two individuals that a given label is perfect. Instead, it invites these individuals to acknowledge that two similarly presented pure tones of the same frequency dependably elicit the same tone color percept. And that regardless of how they would assign the label, they would dependably do so. Think in terms of dark and bright if you wish‚Äîor grave, neutral, and acute, in a nod to Cogan. ASTC allows for a nuanced exploration of a singer‚Äôs sound, but less granular approaches still have value, especially in the voice studio. One final point regarding the ASTC labels in figure 9.1: All of these labels reference vowels that were selected for their typically strong spectral peaks in the related tone color region. So we find [a], but not [ å]; likewise, [i] but not [I]; […õ] as paired with [e] appears to be an exception to me. Especially in the context of considering these pairs to represent the clear (tense) versus neutralized (lax or centralized) versions of a near- similar sound, we can try to make a connection to the acoustical model from chapter 6. In a spectrum of a sustained, speech-pitch sound, we would find the transition from [a] to [ å] characterized by lowering F 1. In the example shown in figure 9.3 (top), note the strength of the F 1 for [a] with a clearly defined peak at 4f o and strong surrounding harmonics. If you imagine the f R1 resonance‚Äîwhich acts as a potential amplifier in the sense of the source-filter model‚Äîmoving to the left in figure 9.3 (bottom) for the [ å], you can see that the F 1 peak has flattened out. The energy surrounding the second formant (F 2) peak between 7f o and 8f o also decreases in intensity.</p>

A look at the waveforms for these two samples brings another dimension to our inquiry. Figure 9.3 shows just three periods of the [a] (top) and [ å] (bottom) waveforms. These samples were selected from high-amplitude portions of each waveform, as ongoing amplitude modulation (shimmer) is a feature of human phonation. The waveform for the [a] is not only higher in amplitude overall but remains higher in amplitude through each pitch period. Here we see the difference in the vocal tract damping of these two vowels. The [a] resonates with greater strength and transfers energy more efficiently from pitch period to pitch period. In the spectra, note that the F 2 peak is ~6 dB stronger in [a] and that the F 1 both lowers in frequency and flattens out as a spectral feature in [ å]. These spectral differences have correlates in the decreased amplitude of the pattern of pressure in the air. If you pass-filter the formants around the third to fourth (3f o‚Äì4f o) and seventh to eighth harmonics (7f o‚Äì8f o) (the spectral representations of the strongest</p>

<p>oscillations within the repeating pressure pattern) for these two vowels, you will hear that their ASTC does not change much. Those tone colors are just expressed more strongly (loudly) in the [a]. Building on the [u] and [i] example in chapter 8 (Figure 8.2), consider how moving from [u] to [i] to [√¶] on the same pitch might impact the power of the fundamental, when f R1 aligns with the fundamental of [i] and [u], but not [ae] (see figure 9.4). Note that the fundamental in [i] is ~11.7 dB stronger than in [√¶], and ~2.3 dB is stronger than in [u]. In all three instances, the tone color contribution of that energy is the same. In my ASTC framework (see figure 9.1), this energy at D4 (~294 Hz) sounds [u]-like: |~u|. This color is strong within the [i] and [u]. It is also present in the [√¶], but weaker. These vowels do not just differ linguistically; their tone color content differs as well. The defining characteristic tone color of [u] becomes a strong secondary color in [i], and relegates to a background color in [ae]. That tone color is either strong or it is not. The tone color of energy at that frequency does not change between these vowels. See Lab #19.</p>

<p>Figure 9.4 A cisgender man singing [i] (top), [u] (middle), and [√¶] (bottom) on D4. Note the dramatic difference between the levels of 1f o between the [√¶] and the other two vowels. Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. If you know how to listen for that |~u| tone color in all three vowels, you can then evaluate its relative strength without a computer. If the |~u| tone color is suppressed in the context of an [i] vowel at this pitch, the resulting sound will likely be thin. You may prize that if you sing into a microphone that automatically boosts the low end of the spectrum. If the |~u| tone color is stronger than usual in the [√¶], the resulting sound will likely be warmer than usual. You may prize that if you sing unamplified music on the treble staff and want to generate a high-amplitude pressure wave. All of these choices are fine aesthetically, but these vowels have very different tone color baselines. The point of ASTC in this context is to be able to notice and effectively describe these baselines and technically relevant deviations.</p>
