<p>oscillating per glottal cycle. These appear as faster ripples per period in the waveform and higher frequency harmonics in the spectrum. This is a function of the vowel, the pitch, and the likely greater contacting area of the vocal folds. The vowel [i] has a higher second formant (F 2) than [a], which explains the faster ripple. The supraglottal impulse at a lower pitch has the potential for a more asymmetrical drop in pressure, which introduces faster rates of change in the supraglottal impulse. This is facilitated by a looser vocal fold cover that likely makes deeper contact. In terms of the sound of this whoop or hoot strategy, the 1f o of the soprano sounds between |~…ë| and |~a| and the countertenor‚Äôs 1f o sounds clearly like |~u|. The same strategy sounds very different at different pitches because tone color is tied to frequency. The countertenor‚Äôs 1f o elicits a tone color that does not exist in the soprano‚Äôs sound because her rate of supraglottal impulses is too rapid. Remember, some aspects of timbre have duration. Because the human hearing mechanism is more sensitive to frequencies in the range of the second formant for [i] than the first formant, the strong oscillation of F 1 (|~u|) is generally not heard as the strongest component of this pressure pattern. The strongest perceptual experience is |~i|. Remember this for later; sometimes the most audible portion of the spectrum points us away from the strongest acoustic forces in the vocal tract. The most noticeable difference between these two kinds of sounds may be the lack of much auditory roughness in the percept of the soprano‚Äôs C6 and the presence of it in the percept of the countertenor‚Äôs E4. This is not to do with those voice types so much as the pitches they are singing. In many approaches to classical treble singing, one would anticipate that auditory roughness would gradually leave the sound as one ascends from the bottom of the treble staff to pitches in the sixth octave. Even if the goal remains to have a bright sound, that brightness will increasingly lose buzziness as a function of ascending pitch.

<p>Another common strategy to build power in a higher singing range aligns multiple repetitions of a vocal tract resonance (either f R1 or f R2) with the pitch period. Singers across genres have worked out how to shape their vocal tract to minimize the damping of this resonance within that period. At a high enough pitch, this generates a continuous oscillation that visibly defines the pitch period in the waveform. In the spectrum, this translates to a single, high-intensity formant in the lower part of the spectrum, which elicits a strong pure percept (no auditory roughness), and it may be dull, cutting, or even edgy, depending on the pitch and vowel shape. The tone color of this single formant is characterized by the ASTC of the peak harmonic, regardless of whether that formant was generated by the first or second resonance (f R1 or f R2). Think about that for a moment. If a vowel is strongly characterized by the presence of one dominant tone color, but fully realized by the presence of co-presenting complementary tone colors, this means that a sung sound with just one of two vowel formants present will necessarily fall short of the timbral complexity of a speech vowel. This has implications for our percept of such sounds. Also, universally present in this way of singing is higher frequency energy that is buzzy (with auditory roughness). This is common in high-energy, typically high-pitched ‚Äúmoney‚Äù notes, and where in the spectrum this buzziness falls has much to do with genre and performance context. Think about how this points to the importance of the relationship between the timing of vocal fold oscillations and vocal tract responses. Also, keep in mind that the voice is not a brass instrument. Unlike the resonances of a metal tube, the resonances of the vocal tract are typically not so strong that they fight vocal fold oscillation when mistimed. At these high-pressure levels though, the nonlinearities of the system do kick in. When well-aligned, these kinds of sounds are incredibly powerful on the outside and experientially easy to produce on the inside. When misaligned, the mismatch between the singer‚Äôs target loudness and the actual loudness typically results in unbalanced, effortful phonation. In a speech-pitch range, the voice is characterized by timbral options. Shade a vowel this way or that way, and you move from one regional accent to</p>

<p>another. Similarly shade that vowel while sustaining a high-intensity ‚Äúmoney note,‚Äù and the entire system may stop working. Remember, we cannot mistake the map for the terrain. I will never suggest that singers executing this resonance strategy think about it in these terms, or that they would need to find these solutions using a computer. Everything I know about singing tells me that singers need (1) a general sense of the target sound, vocal tract shape, and anticipated effort level; (2) an emotional charge that organizes the entire system; and (3) time to play and experiment until they find the solution that feels and sounds the best. I suspect that from the singer‚Äôs point of view, they make a relatively small adjustment as pitch rises that allow them to keep singing. Understanding the underlying physical reality of this adjustment is for the teacher so they can make helpful predictions in the studio. Back to the map: The fact that we hear such a formant peak as close to the tone color percept of a pure tone means that this resonance oscillates to the end of the pitch period. The fact that it has no auditory roughness means it oscillates no more than five times per pitch period. We see these oscillations as a strong 2f o or 3f o (or possibly 4f o or 5f o) in a spectrum or spectrogram. This is common in classical tenors, baritones, and belters who sing high-energy pitches between ~G4 and C5. There are also examples of this dynamic commonly found in belting and mix-belting approaches above C5 in contemporary and some musical theater sounds. As a priming example, here are images from two samples recorded under controlled conditions. Figure 10.7 (top) shows three periods of a classical tenor employing a f R2 ‚âà 3f o resonance strategy on a C5.12 This means that the second resonance (f R2) of the vocal tract oscillates three times for every glottal contacting event, and that the final drop in pressure of the resonance occurs as the vocal folds facilitate a drop in supraglottal pressure. Note that the waveform does show a strong ripple that oscillates three times per pitch period, which corresponds to a strong 3f o in the spectrum. The first resonance (f R1) is significantly dampened, and its effect is diminished in both the waveform and the spectrum. The second example (figure 10.7, bottom) shows a musical theater belt on a</p>

<p>G4 where f R1 ‚âà 2f o. Note that the waveform shows a strong ripple that oscillates two times per pitch period, which corresponds to a strong 2f o. This indicates the interaction of the first resonance (f R1) aligning every other oscillation with the glottal contacting events. I hope your intuition is developing to the point that you would expect a strong ripple that oscillates four or five times per pitch period to appear as a strong 4f o or 5f o, respectively. In all these cases, these high-amplitude, continuously re-excited resonances would collaborate (time well) with the supraglottal impulse to generate a strong excitation of the vocal tract per period.

At this point, I need to acknowledge a limitation on the conclusions we may draw from the samples that follow, because they are taken from</p>

<hr class="page-separator">

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 268</h3>

<p>commercial recordings. In fact, I include the controlled recordings above to point to the credibility of the limited claims that follow. The use of commercial recordings introduces several challenges that impact both the waveform and spectrum. One does not know the distance to or frequency response of the microphone used, nor the electronic post-processing that may have been applied. And the frequency limitations of the recording media can be severe for older recordings. Additionally, frequency filtering and artificial intelligence processing were carried out to remove the confounding effect of the instrumental accompaniment in these samples. So I am not confident that every part of the resulting waveforms and spectra display what would have been captured from these artists with a reference microphone in a controlled environment. We will never know, for example, if a given 1f o would have been 4 dB more intense under laboratory conditions, or whether the loudness of the highest frequency energy is a result of either equalizing the spectrum or applying dynamic compression. However, having worked live with many singers who sing in this way, I am confident that the ways in which these voices are captured here does a good job of accurately representing their gross resonance strategy. This remains true even if the relative intensities of their harmonics, or indeed the objective intensity of their entire voice, are unknowable. I would not use these samples to make more detailed claims beyond the general shapes of the spectra. Discount the accuracy of the waveforms and spectra of these commercial recordings if you must. Or you may strike a middle ground and hedge that we can certainly talk about what the recordings sound like, even if we do not know for sure exactly what the singers sounded like. Given that we observe the same formant structures in singers recorded in a controlled environment as is revealed from the commercial recordings that follow, and given that the target vowels sound comparable in the controlled and commercial recordings, the commercial recording process for the samples that follow would appear not to have so severely reshaped the spectrum of these singers that they provide no hint of these singers‚Äô gross resonance strategies. I might go so far as to suggest that it</p>

<p>strains credulity to imagine that these disconnected commercial recording processes all stumbled onto popular and identifiable resonance strategies when the singer sounded radically different. I would wholeheartedly support the initiative to capture laboratory recordings of elite singers and compile a public research database. With that caveat said in hopes of assuaging the most skeptical among us, I will proceed. Here are examples of three different singers operating in different genres, all executing a f R2 ‚âà 3f o strategy (see figure 10.8). Sarah Bareilles (top) sings a C‚ôØ5 in a cutting mix‚Äëbelt; Franco Corelli (middle) sings a similarly cutting C5 in his full, operatic voice, and Thomas Hampson (bottom) sings a G4. The waveforms each show three periods, and the approximate start of the second and third periods is marked with a dashed line. Note that all three waveforms show a strong ripple that oscillates three times per pitch period, which corresponds to a strong 3f o in all three spectra. The ASTC of that 3f o for Bareilles and Corelli‚Äî approximately 1,662 Hz (around G#6) and 1,569 Hz (around G6), respectively‚Äîfalls into the |~√¶| tone color range. And like the controlled sample in figure 10.7 (top), both of these vowels have a bright, [√¶]-like quality to them. This, despite the [o] and [a] on the page in these two excerpts, respectively.</p>

Filtered by lalal.ai and by author in Praat. The third example (figure 10.8, bottom) further demonstrates how this 3f o strategy generalizes. Here we see a climactic G4 on the word ‚Äòma‚Äô sung by Thomas Hampson. As with Bareilles and Corelli, he has likely aligned every third oscillation of the second vocal tract resonance (f R2)</p>

<p>with the pitch period. Also, as with Bareilles and Corelli, this resonance does not significantly dampen within the period. Does this also sound like [√¶]? It does not. Because his pitch is lower, the ASTC of 3f o (~1,176 Hz) falls on the border of |~…ë| and |~a| rather than |~√¶|. Listening to this sample, you will notice that it sounds as though the indicated [a] vowel neutralizes as the vowel formant region of the spectrum reduces to a single peak. In my experience, baritones identify this as a modification to [ å]. However, as with the Bareilles and Corelli examples, the sound falls short compared to the complexity of a speech-pitch vowel. And the transition from [a] to [ å] at lower pitches tends to decrease the overall amplitude of the pressure wave, which cannot be said for Mr. Hampson here. It may not be that he is consciously neutralizing his sound in the sense of changing vowels; it may be that the acoustic process of two formants simplifying to one brings about a loss of complexity that sounds like a neutralization. This ‚Äúvowel simplification‚Äù raises a semantic question. Despite the high likelihood that the second resonance (f R2) has aligned with the third harmonic (3f o), the damping of the first resonance means that second resonance (f R2) creates the lowest formant in the spectrum. This is technically the first formant (F 1). If we view this phenomenon through the source-filter theory, this is technically a first formant (F 1) strategy. While the above strategy favors aligning every third oscillation of the second vocal tract resonance with the supraglottal impulse, it is also common to align every other oscillation of the first vocal tract resonance with that glottal pattern. We see this referred to as an alignment of f R1 with 2f o. Donald Miller explicitly defines belting according to this acoustic relationship.13 Figure 10.9 shows two examples of this at two different pitches. Steven Pasquale (top) is shown belting a high-energy G4, and Ethel Merman (bottom) is shown belting a C5. Three periods are shown in the waveform, and the approximate start of the second and third periods is marked with a dashed line. Unlike the soprano and countertenor in figure 10.6 or the operatic and contemporary singers in figure 10.8, both Pasquale and Merman have a strong ripple that oscillates twice per</p>
