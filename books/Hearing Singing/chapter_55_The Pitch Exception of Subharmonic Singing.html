<p>THE PITCH EXCEPTION OF SUBHARMONIC SINGING While overtone singing is an approach to phonation that nests a higher pitch percept (continuous oscillation of a resonance) within the longer period of a slower fundamental, subharmonic singing requires that the singer create a periodic sound with a much longer period than the vocal folds might otherwise normally sustain. I would like to point to two ways to conceive of subharmonic singing: (1) by examining the resulting pressure wave and how one perceives its pitch, and (2) by scrutinizing what is likely happening at the level of the glottis to create this pressure wave. Figure 6.8 shows a waveform and spectrum for an [a] sung by a cisgender man on the pitches D ‚ô≠ 3 (top, ~140 Hz) and D ‚ô≠ 2 (bottom, ~70 Hz). D ‚ô≠ 3 (top) is normal modal phonation. The D ‚ô≠ 2 (bottom) is subharmonic phonation. As with figure 6.5, note in the sung D ‚ô≠ 3 that the amplitude of the waveform is greatest at the start of each period and decreases over time. This is a common feature of modal singing, and a common pattern in the singing voices of endogenous testosterone puberty singers in this pitch range. Compare this with the waveform of subharmonic phonation in which there appears to be two excitation phases per period. The primary phase features an initial impulse that excites and dampens within the vocal tract as expected. The secondary phase features a small second boost that introduces new energy into the vocal tract. The pitch percept is generated by the full length of this pattern, which is about 14.2 ms in duration, or 70 Hz. But perhaps counterintuitively, the folds are not neatly opening and contacting once every one-seventieth of a second.</p>

Approximate start of each period marked with a dashed gray line. Source: Recorded by author under controlled conditions. As explored by Jan ≈†vec et al. (1996), non-dysphonic vocal folds permit self-sustaining oscillation in patterns where the vocal folds oscillate with asymmetrical complexity within the glottal cycle. This complexity generates a transglottal airflow pattern that creates the strongest transient whenever the vocal folds meet at their midline.24 When we align the waveforms of normal phonation and subharmonic phonation (see figure 6.8, top and bottom), their periods match exactly in a 1:2 ratio (meaning the pitch percept of subharmonic phonation is an octave below the modal singing pitch), as predicted by ≈†vec et al. Subharmonic phonation appears to leverage the timing theory of pitch perception. Because the transient at the rate of the longer period is stronger than any subsequent within-period change in pressure, the</p>

<p>percept becomes the pitch of the longest period, although the vocal folds are indeed oscillating faster. Any non-dysphonic singer can likely do this, regardless of hormonal regime or age. Infants and young children who lack the vocal motor control of adults may easily slip into subharmonic phonation. Often mistaken for vocal fry, subharmonic phonation routinely punctuates our speech as well. Once you learn to see the telltale additional harmonics of a pitch period an octave lower on a spectrogram or hear the sudden drop of the pitch by an octave, you will be able to identify it with ease (see figure 6.9). Additional subharmonics more than an octave below the intended pitch are also possible, warranting further research. Figure 6.9 A longer time view of the sample that generated Figure 6.8. Subharmonic phonation followed by a switch to modal phonation. Note that subharmonic phonation has additional harmonics between the harmonics of the modal phonation.</p>
