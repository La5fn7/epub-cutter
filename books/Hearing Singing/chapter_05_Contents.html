<p>Contents Acknowledgments Preface Before We Start Who Is This Book For? How to Read This Book 1 Introduction The Purpose of This Book The Problem The Argument The Structure of This Book A Few Important Guardrails and Bits of Housekeeping 2 How We Got Here The Burden of What Is Known About the Voice Not All Singing Transmits Language First Steps Toward Understanding the Timbre of a Voice What We Choose to Notice</p>

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 7</h3>

<p>Conclusion 3 Refining Models for Understanding the Singing Voice Current Pedagogic Models How to Understand Phonation and Resonance in the Vocal Tract How Does the Ear Work? The Most Basic Model of the Ear A Simple Model of the Ear A More Complex Model of the Ear Is Sound a Complex Wave or a Spectrum? Introducing Pitch, Auditory Roughness, and Tone Color Potential Conclusions and Applications Discussion Questions 4 What Is Timbre? What Differs? What Is the Same? Time and Timbre Potential Conclusions and Applications Discussion Questions 5 Pitch Pitch and Timbre How Do We Perceive Pitch? Where pitch is‚Äîand is not‚Äîin a spectrum When Is a Fundamental a Fundamental? Restating the Perceptual Qualities of Pitch</p>

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 8</h3>

<p>Unresolved Harmonics: The Noise in Pitched Sound Issues with the Singer‚Äôs Formant and Pitch Beginning to Understand Pitch in Other Voices Conclusions and Potential Applications Discussion Questions 6 Time‚Äëand‚ÄëPressure Domain Considerations of Pitch and Timbre Modeling Voice Production Without the Fourier Transform The Timing of Timbre What Is Formant Tuning? The Pitch Exception of Overtone Singing The Pitch Exception of Subharmonic Singing The Timbre Exception of Vocal Fry The Pitch Exception of Noisy Distortion Conclusions and Potential Applications Discussion Questions 7 Perceptual Qualities of Auditory Roughness and Pitch Resolution* What Is Auditory Roughness? Exploring Auditory Roughness Experientially Visualizing Critical Bands of Hearing The Equivalent Rectangular Bandwidth The Intersection of Pitch Resolution and Buzziness in a Spectrum</p>

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 9</h3>

<p>The Two-Timbre Model and Beyond Potential Conclusions and Applications Discussion Questions 8 Tone Color and Brightness What Is Brightness? Tone Color: Conflicts between Speech and Musical Sounds The History of Brightness What If Formants Have Tone Colors? Open Questions and Potential Applications Discussion Questions 9 Absolute Spectral Tone Color ABSOLUTE SPECTRAL TONE COLOR: HISTORY AND DEFINITION Absolute Spectral Tone Color: Limitations Exploring Absolute Spectral Tone Color Experientially Vowels Share Common Tone Colors Potential Conclusions and Applications Discussion Questions 10 How Pitch, Auditory Roughness, and Tone Color Intersect: Theory and Application The Timbre of a Formant as Pitch Changes: A Thought Experiment The Intersection of Auditory Roughness, Pitch Resolution, and Tone Color In A Single</p>

<p>Formant The Tone Color of ‚ÄúFlat‚Äù versus ‚ÄúPointy‚Äù Formants Rules of Thumb Some Examples of These Intersections The Obvious True Fundamental A Combined Perceptual Model Perceptual Signifiers of Some Common Resonance Strategies The Tone Color of a Strong 1fo: Solutions for the Treble Staff and Higher The Tone Color of a Strong 3fo or 2fo: Money Notes across Genres Hearing the Entire Spectrum What Can Be Perceived? Conclusions 11 How to Teach Singing How a Singer Should Think The Five Steps in All Singing The Registration Triangle A Few Practical Things to Keep in Mind Is It Consistent? Is It Representative? Different Parts of the Voice What Does a Resonance Strategy Feel Like? How the Entire System Works Respiration</p>
