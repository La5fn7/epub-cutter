<p>THE HISTORY OF BRIGHTNESS Brightness as a parameter of sound is an old idea. As early as 1885, Ernst Mach suggested labeling low and high pure tones as Dumpf (‚Äúdull‚Äù) and Hell (‚Äúbright‚Äù or ‚Äúlight‚Äù).12 Central to the idea of brightness is the notion that low- and high-frequency pure tones are qualitatively different. This idea may be extended to address how the faster and slower oscillations that compose complex tones may be thought of as dark or bright. This should not be controversial to anyone who has worked with singers. Some ways of singing sound warm. Others sound bright. Sometimes these different qualities are present simultaneously. Sometimes we must add brightness to a dark-sounding vowel to make it audible in certain performance contexts. What makes a pure speechlike [u] audible in a concert hall if not for that vowel being fortified with additional brightness that is unnecessary for speech? It makes as much sense to reduce brightness in a sound to the numerical scale of frequency in hertz as it would to do the same for visible light in lumens. While mathematically accurate, this is not how humans experience these phenomena. Anecdotally, I have noticed movement in the fields of voice pedagogy and vocology toward describing the contributions of the first and second formants of the voice in looser, qualitative terms. Bozeman (2013) suggests that the first formant generally provides a ‚Äúdepth‚Äù and the second formant a ‚Äúclarity‚Äù to a given vowel.13 This framing in perceptual terms is incremental but significant as we move toward assigning the perceptual qualities of brightness to the features we see on a spectrum or spectrogram. Bozeman (2021) currently assigns the labels under-vowel and over- vowel to the tone colors of the first and second formants, respectively.14 These labels have found purchase within the voice pedagogy community, crystallizing the idea that one can hear simultaneously sounding qualities of a vowel without centering its semantic properties. As with all models, this one has its limits. Notably, the concept of an under- or over-vowel does not directly point to the changes in overall timbral complexity or tone</p>

<p>color that accompany rising pitch. Nor do these labels invite the potential for meaningful tone color contributions below and above the frequency ranges of the vowel formants. In 2016 I similarly suggested that the first formant can broadly be labeled warm, the second formant clear, and higher formants increasingly bright, like the defining quality of an [i] vowel. Depending on the pitch and vowel, there may also be a further warm [u]-like quality from energy slower (lower in frequency) than the first formant. This slightly more nuanced model also allows one to notice timbral shifts related to pitch. For example, at the pitch F4 an [a] has an additional, darker [u]-like quality due to the frequency of the fundamental. An octave higher, and this quality disappears.15 Plomp (1966) shares a history of brightness that reaches back to the nineteenth century. It is worth including an extended passage here. I encourage you to seek out the original source, as it helps lay out the historical context for much of what follows: Apart from . . . Mach (1885),16 Engel (1886)17 and Stumpf (1890)18 may be regarded as the first promotors of the idea that, in addition to pitch, simple tones have timbre (Stumpf‚Äôs ‚ÄúTonfarbe‚Äù). They realized that only on the basis of this assumption the timbre of complex tones can be understood. K√∂hler (1909, 1911, 1915)19 came to the same conclusion. He gave attention to the fact, also observed by other investigators (Grassmann, 1877;20 von Wesendonk, 1909),21 that simple tones have some resemblance, depending upon frequency, with particular speech vowels. K√∂hler (1911) established that, from low to high frequencies, the character of a simple tone shifts from the German /u/ over /o/, /a/, and /e/ to /i/. . . . In general the order of vowels attached to a tone moving from low to high frequency was confirmed (Weiss, 1920;22 Engelhardt and Gehrcke, 193023 ). It is plain that this resemblance is related to the location of the formants in the frequency range. Recent research indicates that a better agreement can be achieved with two simultaneous simple tones (Morton and</p>

<p>Carpenter, 1962).24 Since it is unlikely that the resemblance between simple tones and particular speech vowels is caused by pitch, it is, as K√∂hler rightly concluded, much more probable that simple tones are characterized by a distinct timbre. As a name for this attribute of simple tones, the term brightness, already used by Mach as we saw above, appears to be the most appropriate one. . . . Although it may seem rather peculiar that two psychological parameters, pitch and brightness, are related to the single frequency parameter of a simple tone, this is not so strange if we accept that pitch is correlated with periodicity and brightness with frequency. For simple tones, period is the reciprocal of frequency, but this is not the case for complex tones.25 Noteworthy in this survey laid out by Plomp is that generation after generation of researchers all observed the same basic principle: Pure sounds change tone color as frequency changes, and the way that such tone colors change bears a similarity to the way that vowels contrast as their formants change. Even Vennard suggests, one ‚Äúwhistle from bottom to top of your range and notice the change from ‚ÄòWhoo‚Äô to ‚ÄòWhee‚Äô.‚Äù26 This basic idea is more than a century old and has been reiterated by a respected research scientist as recently as Plomp (2002): ‚ÄúFor the extreme case of a sinusoidal tone without harmonics, the tone‚Äôs frequency as its single variable determines pitch as well as timbre.‚Äù27 Let us extend this logic to conclude that if all pure tones shared a timbre, Plomp would have no need to clarify this point. Another way to think about this is that vowels leverage this deeper perceptual response. Tone colors are not vowel-like. Vowels are tone color‚Äìlike. This idea appears in music-based theory and perception texts as well. Fritz Winckel (1967),28 Wayne Slawson (1985),29 and Robert Cogan (1998)30 somewhat independently arrive at comparable conclusions. I arrived at the ideas that follow prior to my own exposure to Plomp, Winckel, and Slawson. Why then is this line of inquiry missing from modern voice pedagogy texts? Why is it missing from modern speech science and acoustics texts? It is certainly possible that we are all wrong,</p>

<p>suffering from a century-old hallucination at the intersection of neuroplasticity and suggestibility going all the way back to Mach. After you experience the sounds laid out in the labs, you may find yourself similarly hallucinating. The framework I will describe in what follows is both flexible and limited. In the next chapter I do offer specific brightness labels that have survived extensive empirical exploration, but I am not dogmatic about them. I readily admit those labels have never been tested in the modern era with a large number of naive participants. Training subjects to limit their feedback to the relevant aspect of the stimulus would be onerous, and these percepts are liminal and hard to describe with words. Because some education is required before participating, this implies that this level of specificity is, to an extent, a learned behavior, much like the labels we use for the colors of visible light. That said, the fact that this idea has repeatedly sprung up in various literature for almost a century and a half suggests to me that something important is at work. Well-designed, controlled experiments using modern methods should be carried out. They would undoubtedly spark even more interesting questions that are worth exploring.</p>
