<p>Glossary acoustics: The study of the properties of sound. airflow: The movement of air. In voice science we differentiate between transglottal airflow (direct) and acoustic flow in the vocal tract (alternating). aperiodic: A non-repeating pattern. arytenoid cartilages: A pair of small laryngeal cartilages attached to the back of the cricoid cartilage. The vocal folds attach to these cartilages, and their mobilization moves the vocal folds. auditory roughness: A buzzy percept caused by the population of critical bands of hearing by multiple stimuli. autodissonance: See auditory roughness brightness: The perceptual correlate to frequency. closed quotient: See contact quotient. contact quotient (CQ): The percentage of each glottal cycle where the vocal folds remain in contact, thus reducing or eliminating transglottal airflow. cricothyroid muscles (CT): Laryngeal muscles that tilt the anterior thyroid and cricoid cartilages toward one another. Their effect is to lengthen the vocal folds. critical bands of hearing: The frequency resolution limitation of the basilar membrane (inner ear). declarative (knowledge or language): The words we use to describe a motor task in the body. ‚ÄúKnow what‚Äù language. easefulness: An emergent property of stable singing whereby the listener is not concerned that the singer is concerned about their</p>

<p>own singing. equivalent rectangular bandwidth (ERB): A mathematical formula to estimate the critical bands of hearing. formant: A spectral peak generated by the repeated oscillation of a vocal tract resonance. formant scaling: The idea that the complete set of formants determines vowel identity by their relationships, rather than the frequency regions they fall into. formant tracking: Modifying the vocal tract such that the mathematical relationship between vocal tract resonation and vocal fold oscillation remains the same as pitch changes. Fourier transform: A mathematical process that‚Äîby means of time averaging‚Äîdecomposes a duration of a complex waveform into smaller components, each with frequency, amplitude, and phase. Modern spectrographs use either a discrete Fourier transform (DFT), which acts directly on digital audio samples, or a highly efficient version of the DFT called a fast Fourier transform (FFT). frequency: The number of repetitions of some pattern per second. glottis: The space between the vocal folds. heuristic: A sufficient solution arrived at through experience. high frequency: Rapid changes (in pressure). low frequency: Slow changes (in pressure). missing fundamental: A perceptual phenomenon whereby one perceives the pitch of a periodic tone in the absence of a harmonic component at 1fo. oscillation: Movement back-and-forth around a midline. For example, a child on a swing or pressure waves in the vocal tract. percept: The cognitive experience of a sensory stimulus. period: The duration of a pattern that is repeated. periodic: The regular repetition of a pattern. procedural: (knowledge or language): The internal knowledge of how to execute a motor task in the body. ‚ÄúKnow how‚Äù language.</p>

<p>psychoacoustics: The scientific field concerned with sound perception. pure tone: A reasonably sinusoidal oscillation of pressure that is perceptually similar to a sine wave. register: A range of pitches in the human voice that are produced by a similar mechanism. Some sources point to a consistent timbral quality across this pitch range as well, but this depends on the genre. registration: The coordination of various muscular, aerodynamic, and acoustics actors in a voice that may rebalance to find optimal combinations of pitch, loudness, and timbre for a given aesthetic target. resonance: A term that may be defined in more than one way depending on context. Here it typically means the way a mass (in voice we talk about the vocal tract air mass) continues to oscillate once excited. May also characterize the inherent potential of that system to oscillate if excited or the synchronicity of that oscillation with an external oscillating body. roughness: See auditory roughness. self-dissonance: See auditory roughness. sine wave: A mathematically pure tone with no harmonics. sound: A change in pressure that propagates through a medium and undergoes auditory transduction in a living creature. subharmonic: An extended vocal technique by which asymmetrical oscillations of the vocal folds produce a very low pitch. thyroarytenoid muscles (TA): The laryngeal muscles that make up the body of the vocal folds. Their effect is to shorten the vocal folds and bulge their inferior edge toward the midline. tone color: The perceptual experience of brightness. transglottal airflow: Describing air that flows through the glottis, typically from below. vocal folds: Paired, multi-layered folds of muscle and other tissue housed within the thyroid cartilage. They may be interposed in the flow of air and set into multiple transient or oscillating patterns.</p>
