<p>that now, while turning our focus to the interactions of each subsystem and how they correlate with various perceptual qualities. Respiration The primary muscle of inhalation is the diaphragm. This large, domed muscle separates the abdomen from the rib cage. The contraction of the diaphragm cannot be felt well by a singer, but we can control its actions and know them by their effect on the body. There are many strategies for inhalation, including some that are counterproductive to singing. In singing, the diaphragm typically pushes down against the waterlogged viscera in the abdomen as it contracts. These organs are not compressible, and they transfer the downward motion of the diaphragm both down and out around the abdomen. Interesting things happen when this descent is arrested by abdominal resistance. This may be because of muscular engagement in the abdominal wall, or perhaps because the baseline tone of those muscles prevents further stretching. When either occurs, the breath may appear to go out to the sides, expanding the rib cage, the lower back may lose some of its curve, and the tailbone may rock forward slightly. The diaphragm is a complex structure with multiple connections that affect several different parts of the thorax both simultaneously and in sequence. Ideally its motion is smooth, and its effects are gradual. The descent of the diaphragm appears to influence the vertical position of the larynx in the throat.4 The larynx drops when we yawn, for example, in part because a yawn encourages a deeper inhalation, that further contracts the diaphragm that pulls down on the lungs, trachea, and eventually the larynx. Two behaviors of the larynx in response to this lowering are important.</p>

<p>1. The vocal folds appear to more readily adduct when the larynx is high, and they pull slightly away from one another at baseline as the larynx lowers. You can play with this by phonating with two different lung volumes. There will be a necessary difference in the shape of your pharynx between the two conditions recommended in this exercise, and that‚Äôs fine. First, take a large, yawn- like breath and sing a sustained pitch. Next, exhale almost all of that air and sing the same pitch. The quality of phonation should be noticeably warm versus bright and pressed. 2. The next behavior in this discussion is that the larynx does not move straight up and down in the throat. The thyroid cartilage, the structure that houses the vocal folds, connects to the topmost cartilaginous ring of the trachea, the cricoid cartilage. The cricoid cartilage pulls the larynx along with it as the trachea lowers in the throat. However, the cricoid and thyroid cartilages hinge in the back, and the thyroid cartilage is situated in the frontmost part of the throat. If you touch your thyroid prominence (Adam‚Äôs apple) and imagine a plumb line dropping from that point, it drops down into the empty space in front of your neck. This means that as the trachea pulls down, the cricoid cartilage follows a somewhat diagonal</p>

<p>path down. Because it hinges with the thyroid cartilage in the back, the front of the thyroid cartilage is free to remain more level with the ground as the trachea pulls it down. Thus, the lowering of the larynx both un-presses the vocal folds at baseline and also opens the anterior space between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. As the cricothyroid muscles contract to stretch out the vocal folds, they do so by pulling the front of these two cartilages back together. So the additional space between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages appears to increase the range of motion related to that contraction of the cricothyroid muscles. You can experience this. Take a deep ‚Äúyawn‚Äù breath and glide from your middle voice to a higher pitch. Now blow your air out and try the same thing. You may notice that you strain more to sing the higher pitch when the larynx is higher, the vocal folds are more pressed, and the range of motion between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages decreases. You will also likely need to generate more tracheal pressure to drive this phonation. This will become relevant in a moment. To be sure, I do not advocate that a lowered larynx is the optimal preset condition, especially if that term inspires one to pull the larynx down with muscular force and rigidly keep it there. The larynx freely moves up and down in response to a variety of factors including pitch, timbre, and emotional affect, and an ideal position may not register to the singer as being particularly low. However, it</p>

<p>is important to understand the functional impact of the inhalation of various aspects of the laryngeal setup. Again, we want to end the inhalation with the body exactly where it needs to be to start singing. Different singers exhale for singing in different ways. I am aware that this is the third rail of voice teaching, so I will only share how I think about this. These ideas are incredibly basic and adapt to many different sounds. When I learned this information, it changed the way I related to previous ways of having been taught to breathe. This includes filling in gaps in my education from teachers who did not address breathing at all. In general terms, exhalation is facilitated by several driving forces. Muscular force is perhaps the most obvious. Contracting the muscles that compress the abdomen and rib cage forces air out of the body. There is also elastic recoil at work. Depending on how elongated the abdominal muscles become‚Äîand different bodies will experience different amounts of abdominal expansion‚Äîthey will seek to return to their baseline. Both of these actions will push air out of the body automatically, with no additional muscular effort required. If the singer inhales in a way that expands the rib cage, that structure will add its own elastic recoil as well. In addition to muscular and elastic recoil forces, gravity plays a role in respiration dynamics. Imagine two ways of leveraging the elastic recoil of the abdomen and the rib cage. You could certainly just let the elastic recoil meet its goal of returning these structures to their non-expanded states. To avoid raising the tracheal pressure unmanageably high, you may need to keep some muscles of inhalation somewhat engaged to act as a brake. I observe that this strategy may work especially well with younger singers, given how pliable and accommodating the rest of the system is. However, consider a second option. You could increase the elastic recoil of the rib cage prior to phonation by displacing the abdominal contents in and up. If that sounds</p>

<p>aggressive, keep in mind that this is basically the reverse of the process the diaphragm instigates on the inhalation. Note that this is not a call to engage the muscles of the abdomen that fall along your midline (where I understand a six-pack could hypothetically exist). Those muscles will pull down on the front of your rib cage while the diaphragm is pushed back up in a manner akin to a crunch. We do this when we want to lift something heavy, and it triggers reflexive adduction (Valsalva maneuver) of the vocal folds. The motion I am pointing to does not need to be aggressive at all. It may not even feel like much abdominal engagement. This may seem counterintuitive, but if the initial expansion of the rib cage was due to displacement of the lower ribs by the diaphragm, and perhaps also by the increased volume of air entering the lungs, your rib cage may remain flexible enough to react to the exhalatory abdominal displacement by expanding further. This accomplishes a few helpful things: (1) It generates a strong elastic recoil driving force in the rib cage for regulating tracheal pressure. (2) It decouples engagement of the abdominal muscles from adduction of the vocal folds, which lowers the chance of triggering a reflexive Valsalva maneuver. And finally, (3) it ensures that the opposing muscles within the rib cage that work to compress or expand that structure are not also engaged for postural reasons. The large muscles in the abdomen broadly act on the rib cage, and the small muscles of the rib cage nimbly act on the air in the lungs. If you would like to explore an extreme but instructive version of this inverse relationship between the abdomen and rib cage, you can carry out an isomaneuver. Konno and Mead (1967) suggest taking in a volume of air, holding the breath at the glottis, and displacing ‚Äúas much volume as possible back and forth between the rib cage and abdomen without flexing or extending the spine.‚Äù5 As the abdomen decreases in circumference, the rib cage freely expands. As the</p>

<p>abdomen expands, the rib cage automatically falls. Think of the abdomen as easily moving in and out. This is a low-exertion activity. This may be challenging if you habitually resist the expansion of the abdomen or if you hold the rib cage rigid. And to be sure, this is a dramatic illustration of this relationship. The respiration subsystem may then be understood as two related subsystems. The abdomen is responsible for accommodating the initial descent of the diaphragm. Depending on the sound one wants to make, this may be a relatively small or large descent. The abdomen is also responsible for displacing its own expansion to provide upward force on the diaphragm. This allows the rib cage to expand even further without exerting much muscular or postural effort. Meanwhile, it puts the muscles that compress and expand the rib cage right in the middle of their ranges of motion. This is where they can apply the most force for the least effort.6 The elastic recoil of the rib cage may then be leveraged for much longer before muscular effort must kick in, and it becomes the responsibility of the muscles of the rib cage to regulate tracheal pressure. This allows you to remain above the resting expiratory lung volume for much longer as you sing. This is the exhalatory threshold, where elastic recoil forces stop and muscular forces must take over. Many ways of breathing for singing fit this basic scaffold. This is true even if they look a little different in different bodies, or facilitate different sounds based on where the body ends up at the end of the inhalation. Simply expanding the abdomen less before displacing that volume back into the rib cage changes the output. This exploration of the respiration subsystem ultimately describes a process that efficiently and maximally expands the rib cage, storing up elastic recoil energy that may then slowly be released. One could certainly phonate while allowing the air to fall out with no further activity beyond the elastic recoil of the abdomen and ribcage.</p>
