<p>WHAT IS AUDITORY ROUGHNESS? There is the potential for confusion whenever two fields of study use a similar term to describe different phenomena. A wide range of sounds may be described as rough, many of which likely leverage similar innate reactions of our hearing mechanism. Indeed, in speech pathology, the term ‚Äúroughness‚Äù labels an undesirable, uneven sound caused by aperiodic noise in the voice signal.5 We frequently attempt to rehabilitate this when it interferes with our ability to sing or communicate. Within artistic singing practices, ‚Äúrough‚Äù can also point to technical approaches that allow one to sustainably produce extreme sounds like grunts, growls, and screams.6 And many singing artists split the difference, forming their characteristic sound around a rough quality that another singer might want to reform. In the study of psychoacoustics, the compound term ‚Äúauditory roughness‚Äù may be used interchangeably with ‚Äúroughness,‚Äù but in both cases these terms point to a perceptual phenomenon. In this book, both terms point to the physiological and perceptual process that gives rise to these rough perceptual qualities rather than an overall voice quality per se. Of course, since the ear helps create the sound of a singer, it is difficult to parse out these distinctions. The buzzy perceptual quality of auditory roughness explored here is distinct from the roughness one might associate with myriad extreme artistic choices, pathologies, or even functional deficits. It is, however, present as a normal, familiar, desirable buzzing quality that we tend to cultivate in robust singing.7 The reader will remember from chapter 3 that the basilar membrane has frequency resolution limitations. Moving from the physiological to the perceptual, as counterintuitive as this might be, the percept associated with multiple stimuli falling into a critical band is a buzzy sound. Next, I will describe how to explore and experience this percept in isolation. Different authors explain auditory roughness differently. Typically, they frame the phenomenon in terms of the distance between two simultaneously presented pure stimuli. This distance is characterized in</p>

<p>either Hz or musical intervals. In a physical sense, auditory roughness is a phenomenon that exists because of the physical proximity of the separate basilar membrane responses to those separate stimuli. In practical terms, we may both calculate the width of the proximity of this effect for specific lengths of the basilar membrane in Hz, or we may think more simply, using musical intervals. Both measurements ultimately point to a physical distance along the basilar membrane. Howard and Angus (2017) frame auditory roughness in reference to the beating quality created when two equally loud pure tones are less than 12.5 Hz apart. As the two tones approach a unison, the beating slows until it disappears. When separated by greater than around 15 Hz, this beating quality goes away and becomes a fused percept with a rough quality. As the distance in frequency between these two tones continues to grow, the rough percept disappears, replaced by the percept of two clearly separate tones.8 Heller (2013) uses the umbrella terms self-dissonance and autodissonance to capture both beating and roughness, and he places this in a musical context.9 If a musical interval would be close enough to trigger a dissonant musical sound, the higher harmonics of a complex tone with the same intervallic relationship to one another will similarly sound ‚Äúself-dissonant.‚Äù He points to intervals closer than a perfect fourth as the threshold for this phenomenon. He also cautions that we cannot assume that the higher harmonics of a periodic sound will behave as independent pure tones do, suggesting that ‚Äúa perfectly fine, rich tone may be dissected for dissonant partners contained in the sound, yet the dissonances are not evident in the whole tone.‚Äù10 Similarly, Sundberg (1987) frames ‚Äúroughness of the timbre‚Äù in a voice in terms of the position of harmonics within the harmonic series, suggesting that auditory roughness can only arise from ‚Äúpairs of partials above the fourth partial.‚Äù11 The fifth and sixth harmonics are less than a major third apart, with every subsequent pair of harmonics separated by smaller and smaller musical intervals. Thus, only the higher frequency (faster oscillations) harmonics of a periodic sound trigger auditory roughness.</p>

<p>Again, we find two different framings of auditory roughness: in relation to distance between tones in Hz and distance between tones in musical intervals. Perhaps we can note that the term beats, made distinct in Howard and Angus, describes an additional rough phenomenon characterized by wave-interference pulses that fall below the lower threshold of pitch perception (under about 20 Hz). As I will explore below, such pulses are rarely a feature within a single singing voice. Thus, a musical interval between adjacent harmonics may make more sense as a rule of thumb than a frequency-difference threshold. Here are a few examples: Consider that two separately presented tones at 100 Hz and 106 Hz (approximately one half step apart) would produce wave-interference beats six times per second (see figure 7.1, top) and would sound rough. In fact, two tones at 200 Hz and 206 Hz will also beat six times per second and sound rough, although it turns out that their musical interval is narrower than a half step (see figure 7.1, middle). This is likely counterintuitive, but remember that pitch perception is nonlinear. Doubling or halving the frequency raises or lowers the pitch by an octave. Adding around 6 percent to the frequency raises the pitch a half step. The frequency difference between the two pitches in a musical interval will always depend on the starting frequency. Musical intervals are ratios, not fixed changes in frequency.</p>

(Bottom) 100 Hz pulsing pattern formed by simultaneous pure tones at 1.6 kHz and 1.7 kHz. Source: Synthesized by author in Praat. Continuing this exploration, the sixteenth and seventeenth harmonics of a tone at 100 Hz (1,600 Hz and 1,700 Hz, respectively) are also approximately a half step apart, but they do not trigger the same beats as the previous two examples did (see figure 7.1, bottom). This is because their interference pattern pulses at 100 Hz, which falls well within the range of human pitch perception. We hear that pulsing as a pitch. In fact, for adjacent harmonics of a periodic tone to produce beats, the fundamental would have to be less than 15 Hz. This would sound like a</p>

<p>series of regularly repeating pulses rather than a pitch. So in a voice, Heller‚Äôs autodissonance always produces pulses; we just hear pulses faster than about 20 Hz as a pitch. As mentioned above, when two pure tones approach each other in frequency, strong pulses or beats are perceived at the frequency of the difference in their frequencies. Such beats have both a correlate in the physical world and a cognitive aspect. When combined in the air, two tones separated by 6 Hz (e.g., 100 Hz and 106 Hz) will form an interference pattern that pulses six times per second (see again figure 7.1, top). Since this pulsing is slower than 20 Hz, it will generate a rhythmic rather than a pitched percept. We can also explore a less pronounced beating quality called binaural beats by playing these two separate tones over headphones, one in each ear. The emergence of binaural beats while listening to slightly different tones in each ear implies a cognitive mechanism is at work. We can be confident in this inference because the two pressure patterns never have the chance to interfere in the air.12</p>
