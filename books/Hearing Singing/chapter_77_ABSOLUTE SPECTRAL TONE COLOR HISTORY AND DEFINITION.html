<p>ABSOLUTE SPECTRAL TONE COLOR: HISTORY AND DEFINITION Before diving into the definition of absolute spectral tone color, I want to share how I arrived at this term, and why these specific words matter. In 2013 I offered the term absolute timbre to point to qualitative aspects of the tone color qualities explored in chapter 8.1 As Cornelia Fales (2002) quips, ‚ÄúTimbre is a slippery concept and a slippery percept, perceptually malleable and difficult to define in precisely arranged units.‚Äù2 Yet Plomp supports the idea that ‚Äúsimple tones have timbre‚Äù related to their objectively measurable frequency‚Äîin other words, their brightness.3 I saw the term absolute timbre as a way to point to that narrow tone color‚Äì related aspect of timbre that appears to have an objective quality without suggesting that timbre in its entirety was objective. If tone color relates to frequency and only applies to pure tones, there are no further timbral considerations to muddy the tone color percept of that pure tone. However, it became quickly apparent that the term timbre used in this way problematically denotes other qualities of a sound beyond the tone color itself, regardless of the context provided. In place of absolute timbre, I started to use the term absolute spectral tone color (ASTC). This new term calls attention to the attribute of timbre in question: It is the brightness itself, rather than how the presence of brightness fluctuates over time. The term spectral points to the relationship of the frequency domain to brightness as a timbral property. The unqualified nature of the word absolute‚Äîa fighting word when discussing perception‚Äîhonors the idea that for a simple tone, the frequency determines both pitch and timbre. Thus, two pure tones of the same frequency, separately produced, will share a common tone color percept. A short sidebar: As loudness is controlled for in the ANSI definition of timbre, the pitch percept‚Äîand therefore the tone color‚Äîof a pure tone varies somewhat with intensity. In this limited case, the way the human</p>

<p>ear processes the frequency of a pure tone stimulus affects not just pitch perception but also our perception of the frequency. You can explore this idea by doing the following: Generate a sine wave at 100 Hz using Audacity, Praat, Madde, VoceVista Video Pro, or another compatible program of your choice. Use headphones, which will nullify potential head position‚Äìrelated phasing issues when listening to a pure tone over speakers. Slowly decrease the playback volume from loud to barely perceptible. You will notice that the pitch percept rises slightly as the sound becomes quieter. Repeat this experiment with a 3 kHz tone and you will notice that the opposite occurs: As you decrease the playback volume, the pitch percept lowers slightly.4 The degree of intensity- modulated pitch drift is not so severe that it noticeably changes the tone color of the sound; but, strictly speaking, the measurable frequency of a pure tone is not always the absolute correlate to the pitch percept. See Lab #16. Most periodic sounds we encounter are at least a little bit complex, and the pitch percept variability of pure tones will likely never rise to the level of your attention in the voice studio. However, this does help to explain a phenomenon that always bothered me and that you may have also noticed. If I listen to music that begins with several bars of a dull- sounding bass guitar and no other pitched instrument, I am frequently surprised by the key when chordal or melody instruments join. Once those more complex patterns vibrate along with the simpler bass sound, that bass sound snaps into the right key in my perception. Those kinds of bass sounds are too close to a pure tone to trigger the correct pitch percept on their own. With this sidebar concluded, I will proceed with the definition of ASTC. In my 2016 dissertation I define absolute spectral tone color in the following way: Any two or more simple sounds (for example a sine wave, [a pass-filtered] harmonic of a complex tone, or narrowly notch filtered band of noise) of identical frequency, regardless of their sources, will produce an identical tone color percept independent</p>

<p>of other spectral fluctuations considered aspects of timbre. If these simple sounds are located within a complex sound, their inherent absolute spectral tone color is never lost or changed, only expressed or masked. These tone colors may be placed on a continuum and bear a meaningful similarity to several vowels.5 If one describes the tone color of simple sounds along a continuum of brightness (as Plomp [1966] suggests is long accepted in psychoacoustics),6 the principle of absolute spectral tone color requires that we label any two simple sounds of the same frequency with an identical brightness value. Similarly, if we adopt Cogan‚Äôs [(1998]) register-based system and divide timbre into grave, neutral, and acute regions, two simple sounds of the same frequency exhibit exactly the same quality of graveness, neutrality, or acuteness.7 It matters less that we use a specific scale [or labels] than that we make the conceptual leap that there are absolute values along the continuum.8 The underlying logic here is that recognizing the similarity in tone color of two separately produced pure tones at the same frequency (and intensity to a very minor extent) is more important than how one confronts and labels that phenomenon. This is the central idea of ASTC, which acknowledges how limited this perceptual property is. Figure 9.1 illustrates this scale with labels I assigned to help us understand the dominant spectral signifiers of certain vowels. These labels also serve as a way to identify and understand the tone color contributions of complementary, non-vowel-defining portions of any spectrum. This includes energy below F 1 and above F 2 and demonstrates that only one vowel formant (frequently but not exclusively F 2) provides the identifying tone color of the vowel. The methodology for deriving these boundaries is explored in greater detail in Howell (2016). My earlier findings are based on listening experiments using pure tones and small clusters of harmonics.9 If you are interested in exploring this, please look at Lab #17.</p>
