<p>TONE COLOR: CONFLICTS BETWEEN SPEECH AND MUSICAL SOUNDS Tone color is perhaps the most controversial idea covered in this book. It is easy to experience but challenging to write about. I would like to suggest that part of the potential resistance to tone color as a phenomenon is semantic; another part is due to a lack of grounding in historical context; and much of the remaining resistance represents basic conflicts between those who study speech and language and those who study the timbre of musical sounds (including singing). No one who studies the voice argues against the idea of co-presenting sound colors. This idea is already encoded into our use of the term chiaroscuro, or ‚Äúbright darkness.‚Äù A complex sound can have multiple aspects of brightness and darkness at once. One frequently finds statements in the voice pedagogy literature to the effect that vowels have inherent pitches,5 or that what differentiates one vowel from another is the presence of higher or lower frequency spectral peaks. William Vennard (1967) notes that certain vowels also share spectral peaks: When one sings Ay [e], he is really singing Oh [o] plus a high partial which is not heard in the Oh [o]; and when one sings Ee [i], he is really singing Oo [u], plus a still more ringing overtone.6 Roughly put (and this is not strictly accurate), adding higher frequency energy to [o] and [u] results in [e] and [i]. I urge you to hear this and experience it personally in Lab #13. It is challenging to accept this without wondering if what characterizes those brighter vowels exists primarily in that higher frequency energy. This is a departure from the prevailing idea in speech research that vowel identification and paralinguistic cues about the speaker leverage the relationship between the frequencies of the formants rather than the frequencies of the formants themselves.7 This view is called formant-scaling.</p>

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 193</h3>

<p>The common formant-scaling argument is that the same phoneme uttered by different speakers‚Äîor by the same speaker attempting to imply they are physically larger or smaller than they are‚Äîmay be understood based on the rough similarities of their formant structures. This is despite sometimes radically differing vocal tract dimensions, accents, languages of origin, and objective formant frequency measures. This is a reasonable way to simplify the complex variability of speech sounds between speakers. Evidently, the perceived vowel is the entire formant structure all at once. How else could speakers with differing formant frequencies convey the same vowel? However, singers are arguably as interested in the aesthetic qualities present in a sound as they are in the linguistic content of that sound. Grafting this framework on the study of the singing voice‚Äîwhere the vowel is ‚Äúall of those formants at once‚Äù‚Äîmay lead to analysis paralysis. However, if this were true, how could treble singers make vowel sounds at pitches higher than the first formant? The answer to this dilemma seems reasonably simple. In this context, the idea of a vowel does not point to a specific sound so much as it points to a range of sounds based on the behavior of the articulators in the context of the surrounding phonemes found in spoken language. The notion of a vowel‚Äîand of a phoneme more broadly‚Äîpoints to a group of somewhat similar sounds that all serve the same function in spoken language. This is because the idea of a vowel within such a model is conceived semantically; the vowel is less tied to the timbre of the sound than it is linked to the meaning that sound evokes in a linguistic context. A vowel is really a conceptual ‚Äúcontainer‚Äù for a group of differently timbred sounds. So we would expect that the timbres of a child and an adult speaking the same vowel would be dissimilar, even if their articulators trace similar paths relative to their anatomy. Likewise, the timbre of someone speaking an American [a] with a thick Russian accent is different from that of a native speaker of American English from the Midwest. Additionally, relative to singing, speech generally occupies a restricted and lower average pitch range. Titze (2017) writes that ‚Äúthe larynx as a</p>

<h3>–°—Ç—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ 194</h3>

<p>sound source in speech is limited in its range and capability because a low fundamental frequency is ideal for phonemic intelligibility and source-filter independence.‚Äù8 If speech occupies a lower pitch range than singing, this means the vocal tract is allowed to resonate longer for each pitch period. This longer period more fully realizes the complexity of the resonant response of the vocal tract, which in turn allows more subtle variability in timbre. As Titze writes, this also increases source-filter (vocal folds and vocal tract) independence as the amplitude of the oscillations in the vocal tract has time to significantly dampen between glottal contacting events. These time-and-pressure properties of speech appear in a spectrum or spectrogram as multiple harmonics that occupy the frequency ranges of each vocal tract resonance. As a result, a wide range of resonant formant frequencies are possible. Within the context of the flow of spoken language‚Äîwhere ongoing timbral variation is a feature‚Äîthe actual tone colors present in a spoken vowel do not tend to matter more than that vowel‚Äôs adjacent consonants, vowels, glides, or pauses. This process is called coarticulation.9 Denes and Pinson (2015) write that ‚Äúthe speech wave has very few segments whose principal features remain even approximately static.‚Äù10 For example, native English speakers will notice the difference between the /k/ sounds in keep and cool to get a sense of how the vocal tract shape of the vowels [i] and [u] change the tone color of the initial consonant. Now compare the [i] in tea and peep to note how the [i] is subtly changed by the initial consonant. Singing is different. What is a vocalise or melisma but an exploration of the language-free timbre of a specific registration setting through a specific vocal tract shape at a specific pitch? Entire pedagogic approaches are built on the idea that vowels modify or migrate.11 Singers cover to the top, narrow in the passaggio, bloom, add hoot, track ring or cut, align all their vowels, sing with a sob or cry, and so on. None of these descriptive terms are relevant to discussing functional speech or linguistic meaning. In many cases we may do better to consider the sound of a voice as we would a musical instrument. There are ways to play the voice that allow for the efficient and inefficient navigation of certain pitch ranges. We</p>

<p>sometimes color the voice in the process of achieving a technical outcome. I started this chapter suggesting that tone color is a challenging topic to discuss with the necessary nuance. In this section I have pointed to challenges inherent in grafting conclusions from the study of speech onto singing. To continue our discussion of tone color, we return to the idea of brightness.</p>
