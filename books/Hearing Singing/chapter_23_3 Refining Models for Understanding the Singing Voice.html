<p>3 Refining Models for Understanding the Singing Voice The singing voice is too complex to grasp all its details all at once. Instead, we use models to teach important, generalizable concepts. Because it is the nature of all models to exclude information, the art of creating a good model lies in knowing which information to leave out. By definition, models are missing information. A single model that has been designed to characterize an aspect of the voice is only ever an incomplete way to think about singing. At the heart of this chapter is a very basic set of questions: Do models based on the source-filter theory‚Äîwhere the vocal folds generate a spectrum of harmonics filtered by the vocal tract‚Äîcapture the physical nature of voice production, or do they pull voice teachers away from a deeper understanding of vocal function? How does the ear transduce the information in sound waves, and how does that process affect what we hear? Does the output of a spectrum or spectrogram adequately represent the perceptual qualities of a voice? And finally, are there other, equally viable models we could deploy in place of the source-filter model? In teaching voice acoustics‚Äîand I will start with voice acoustics because it generates so many conceptual models‚Äîwe lean heavily upon spectra and spectrograms and the language of the source-filter theory of voice production. These images show the results of a Fourier transform. The Fourier transform is a mathematical process that decomposes a</p>

<p>complex pattern (an audio recording, for example) into simpler waveform components with specific frequencies, amplitudes, and phases. By combining the frequency, amplitude, and phase of each simple waveform component, we can redraw the complex waveform. If the audio recording is periodic‚Äîwhich means it likely has a pitch‚Äîthe Fourier transform will return a spectrum of harmonics of varying intensities. The frequency and amplitude components are usually displayed in this spectrum, while the phase information is hidden. The resulting harmonics (prominent simple components generated by the Fourier transform) commonly form the basic visual language that we use to conceptualize resonances, formants, vowels, and the other elements that form the acoustic signature of a voice. Despite conceptual similarities, the ear processes complex, periodic tones differently than a Fourier transform. In this chapter, I will begin to explore the ways in which these two processes produce different results. I believe that voice teaching is, at its core, a heuristic pursuit. There is no one piece of information that could be found in a voice pedagogy or vocology book that is automatically helpful. The razor of practical application is ready to dismiss ideas that seem to bear no immediate practical benefit to the training of a voice student. And this is likely as it should be: Hard truths bend to the practical needs of real human singers who are seeking solutions amid their complex emotional and physical experiences of life. But it means that our practical teaching models are typically only as accurate as they need to be in order to get the job done given what our target audience already understands. Our models are sufficient and helpful rather than accurate or complete. Again, most would argue this is as it should be. However, this does mean that our field is structurally vulnerable to centering problematically incomplete models. The models we use to explain singing tend to be organized by the systems into which we subdivide the singing body. We tend to discuss the singing body in terms of these discrete subsystems: respiration, phonation, resonation, and articulation. This popular organizational structure leaves out two important subsystems: radiation (the ways in which the sound of a voice changes because of the room) and perception (the act of hearing). Additionally, it frequently leaves out the role of the</p>

<p>brain in instigating the singing in the first place, but that is largely beyond the scope of this book. I wonder how our corporate understanding of the singing voice would change if these pedagogical models accommodated what is already known from the study of sound perception (psychoacoustics). Psychoacoustics offers important tools to explore voice production. Rather than simply observing the objectively measurable aspects of a singer‚Äôs audio signal, we can begin to ask more actionable questions such as: What does that aspect of the singer‚Äôs spectrum sound like? What does it contribute to the whole? Does that part of the spectrum represent pressure and flow patterns that play a role in sustaining phonation? Does that part of the spectrum stimulate my ear in a way that the act of perception dependably introduces qualitative elements of timbre? Can I train my ear to listen for those qualities and then link them to successful or unsuccessful attempts at a technical or functional goal? Can I hear everything I see on a spectrum or spectrogram? Can I use this information to revise the models I currently use to better conceptualize, or better teach others to understand the behavior of the voice? As I wrote in the last chapter, the field of voice pedagogy has already assimilated ideas from anatomy, physiology, linguistics, and acoustics. We are currently attempting to do the same with motor learning theory, learning theory, and neuroscience. In cases where such synthesis has proven useful, the interdisciplinary mingling can provide additional support and explanations for what works well, can generate new teaching frameworks, and in some cases can even reform what have been questionable assumptions. Open any modern voice pedagogy book to see how these topics delineate chapters. Whether the information therein successfully connects to the needs of the singers and teachers who read it is another question. What follows is meant to enliven what works well in our current models, while seeking to account for some of the unsatisfying</p>
