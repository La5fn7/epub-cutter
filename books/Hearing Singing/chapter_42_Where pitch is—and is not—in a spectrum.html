<p>WHERE PITCH IS‚ÄîAND IS NOT‚ÄîIN A SPECTRUM Let us reflect on two intuitive ways to imagine how to locate the pitch percept in a spectrum or spectrogram set to show harmonics. One way is to assume that the fundamental (the lowest harmonic) is the pitch while the other harmonics add other aspects of timbre. VoceVista Video Pro appears to support this notion by drawing its pitch-tracking line overtop the fundamental on the spectrogram. Another way to imagine how pitch appears in a spectrogram is to view everything as part of the pitch. As we will see, both options are wrong. When viewed on a spectrum or spectrogram, pitch as a percept arises from the lower frequency range of the total spectrum. Depending on the source consulted, this may be as low as the lowest five harmonics (1f o‚Äì5f o)11 or, at most, the lowest eight (1f o‚Äì8f o).12 Perceptually, these lower harmonics are said to resolve into the pitch. Higher harmonics are termed unresolved and do not contribute to the pitch percept. Indeed, from about the ninth harmonic (9f o) and higher, the energy of a human voice progressively contributes a pitch-less, bright, buzzy noise akin to the sound of a cricket. This noise is distinct from other forms of stochastic noise (for example, air turbulence or white noise), but it is conspicuously distinct from the pitch percept. A voice featuring strong energy above the eighth harmonic (8f o) will typically have a strong and cutting noisy element. This may seem academic, but keep in mind that we are on the lookout for dependable, qualitative aspects of timbre. If we know that only part of the spectrum generates the pitch percept, we can place that in qualitative opposition to the part that does not. Crucially, this means we can dependably hear with specificity vocal functions that either do or do not generate that higher frequency energy. It is worth exploring the nature of this noise for a moment. We just learned that unresolved harmonics do not necessarily sound like other, more familiar types of noise. They are more similar to the buzzing sound of crickets than a crash cymbal. When isolated, these unresolved harmonics may elicit a pitch percept (or even several simultaneous pitch</p>

<p>percepts) of their own. However, unresolved harmonics typically do not dependably generate the correct pitch percept. Crossing from harmonic eight to nine (8f o‚Äì9f o) does not immediately introduce this noise. As Plomp (2002) notes, ‚ÄúThe unresolved higher harmonics may also contribute [to the pitch percept], but to a lesser extent.‚Äù The frequency of the fundamental (1f o) plays a role as well. Above about C5, the ninth harmonic (9f o) will always fall above our 5 kHz pitch perception threshold, decreasing the likelihood that such energy can resolve into the pitch anyway. This &gt; 5 kHz unresolved frequency information may be identified as a separate percept, in a perceptually bright space above and distinct from the pitch. See Lab #5. Note that although one may visually identify the slower (lower frequency) and faster (higher frequency) aspects of a waveform, that a spectrum or spectrogram far more readily allows one to identify the waveform‚Äôs resolved versus unresolved components. Remember that the objective correlate to pitch in the waveform is either the duration of the periodic pattern expressed in milliseconds or the frequency of its repetition expressed in cycles per second, or hertz (Hz). The physical aspects of that pattern that are unresolved from the pitch typically occur within that pattern. There is no easy way to visualize which ripples in a complex waveform will unfold over time (resonate) to represent unresolved information. Think back to the model explored in chapter 3. Per period of voicing, the resonances of the vocal tract are excited by the drop in transglottal airflow facilitated by the contacting of the folds. These resonances then quickly dampen until they are re-excited by the next vocal fold‚Äìcontacting event, and the result of this complex event is captured as a function of time in a waveform. The slower ripples (lower frequency) visible in such a waveform typically oscillate longer per period than faster ripples (higher frequency) do; this is because the vocal tract preferentially dampens higher frequency oscillations.13 One developing conceptual framework aligns the resolved portion of the spectrum with the slower ripples that are allowed to oscillate to the end of the period, while the unresolved</p>

<p>portion of the spectrum may correspond to the faster ripples that shock into existence at the start of every period, only to rapidly dampen. I suggest a middle path of sorts. It is incredibly useful to follow the literature and describe the threshold between resolved and unresolved portions of the spectrum in terms of harmonics of the fundamental. It asks just a little more nuance of us to keep in mind that harmonics characterize repeatedly occurring energy within a repeating pattern, not necessarily persistently oscillating pressure patterns. This opens the door to the potential value of a time-and-pressure-based approach in terms of understanding resolved versus unresolved spectral energy that will be explored in chapter 6. Recall also from chapter 3 that as the complex pressure wave propagates through the cochlea, the basilar membrane cannot clearly resolve what a spectrum or spectrogram may display as higher harmonics. The information is either so tightly clustered along the basilar membrane ‚Äîor is sufficiently aperiodic as a physical phenomenon‚Äîthat it becomes impossible to extract the pitch. In a way of thinking, we should discard that detail in a spectrum anyway. Please keep in mind that little research has been carried out to explore these thresholds with sung sounds. More work remains to be done. Notwithstanding that thought experiment, we must keep in mind that both the place theory and the timing theory are understood to be processes of the cochlea and brain. This means that pitch arises after the processing of the stimulus by the inner ear.14 So despite the declaration that frequency and periodicity are the physical correlates to pitch, pitch only ever exists in the brain. Crucially, the pitch percept is not the cognitive experience of interpreting pressure patterns as they exist in the air. It is the cognitive experience of that phenomenon after it has passed through the process of auditory transduction. Spectra and spectrograms show the decomposition of the pressure wave as it exists in the air.</p>
