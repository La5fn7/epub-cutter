<p class="chaptitle"><a id="page_32" class="calibre1"></a>1a. Knowing What You Do</p>
<p class="h3a">Patterns and Habits</p>
<p class="noindent">‚ÄòThey said they didn‚Äôt see me as vulnerable enough to read for the part. It‚Äôs ridiculous. Of course I can play a vulnerable character! It‚Äôs called <i class="calibre8">acting</i>. That‚Äôs my job!‚Äô</p>
<p class="indent">Maybe. Maybe not.</p>
<p class="indent">No one starts as a blank piece of paper on which to write any character, and no one can ever truly become one however hard they try. That is not as controversial as it may initially sound to some. As the renowned teacher Jacques Lecoq said: ‚ÄòOf course there is no such thing as absolute and universal neutrality. It is merely a temptation.‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn14" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn14" class="calibre6">14</a></sup> We will get to the uses of the study of neutrality (which Lecoq made famous) in <a href="chapter_13_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#AFM60-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 3</a>, but first it is important to acknowledge this: we are unique individuals and recognisably so. The mould got broken every time. We each have our own unique expression of an individual genome; we went through a childhood that no one else did; we have had (and continue to have) our own experiences of life; we learnt our own way of standing, turning, bending, reaching, walking, thinking, breathing ‚Äì no one else does it exactly the same. Not just our genes and structure but our many stories have shaped and continue to shape our very fabric, and to fashion the very specific patterns and habits of <a id="page_33" class="calibre6"></a>doing, responding and being that we all have. We cannot simply strip it all away.</p>
<p class="indent">And that is not necessarily a bad thing for actors. In a sense it‚Äôs a gift: this is material you can use. Some of the patterns and habits you have will be the reason you get the part as well as the reason you don‚Äôt; they might even be the reason that the audience will (or already do!) turn out or switch on in their millions to see you. But, of course, not all patterns: some of them you may wish you could change so that you could do something differently ‚Äì or just better. Some of them will be getting in the way without you even knowing. Many of your patterns and habits are shiftable, changeable, expandable, variable ‚Äì you aren‚Äôt necessarily stuck with all of them as they are for ever ‚Äì but if you want to do anything differently you need to know what you are doing in the first place. You will take these patterns and habits of yours onstage, in front of the camera and when you walk through the door for an audition. It‚Äôs important to be very clear from the beginning that this is what you are working with, and to appreciate that one thing that can really enhance your acting is to know as much as you can about the very particular patterns and habits that are currently yours. If you don‚Äôt, there is less you will be able to do with or about them: your choices will be constrained in ways that you may not even recognise. Becoming aware of your patterns of moving and being at ever-deepening levels and in progressively finer detail, as well as learning to expand and develop them, are skills the Feldenkrais Method enables particularly well. It is a way of becoming freer from the tyranny of habits in a way that, in my experience, works beautifully with Lecoq‚Äôs idea of neutrality, not against. These are some significant reasons for an actor to practise the Method and a great place to start.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindentb" id="ind10"><a id="page_34" class="calibre6"></a><b class="calibre7">How Much Do You Know About What You Do?</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1">Take a really simple everyday action like walking. Do you know what you are doing when you walk? It‚Äôs actually a huge question as they still (as far as I am aware) haven‚Äôt been able to build a robot that can truly walk like a human being because it is so complex. But ask yourself just a bit of it:</p>
<p class="noindentb1">What do you do to bring your right leg forward? Do you twist the pelvis? (If so, in what direction?) Does the hip go up/down/neither? Do you bend sideways in the ribs? (If so, to which side?) What does your right shoulder do? Lift/drop? Move forward/backward/neither? Does your lower back lengthen/shorten/neither? How is your breastbone involved? What does your head do? Where do you look with your eyes? What part of your foot (exactly) is the last to leave the floor? How does the weight shift on your other foot? And do you do the same when you bring the other leg through? (Extremely unlikely ‚Äì but what‚Äôs the difference?)</p>
<p class="noindentb1">That‚Äôs just a few questions, I could think of many more. I‚Äôm not really expecting you to have that much of an idea unless you happen to be an expert: if you had any answers you did well.</p>
</div>
<p class="h">How You Developed Those Patterns</p>
<p class="noindent">Before we go further, it‚Äôs important to unpack a little of the background to the rather bald initial assertions I have made. Important because, as we will see, this is fundamental to the Feldenkrais Method and it‚Äôs really very interesting for actors. I don‚Äôt want to get bogged down in the detail of the scientific evidence for how we learn, so I am going to stick to what we really need to understand the Method, and to elucidate what you are working with as an actor. I have included references and there is suggested Further Reading (in the Appendix) if you want to explore this area further.</p>
<p class="indent">To understand how you acquired the patterns and habits you have, and to appreciate their depth and complexity, we need to <a id="page_35" class="calibre6"></a>go back in time. When you were born your nervous system was not all wired up as it is now. The basic life functions that involve movement were wired up ‚Äì breathing and circulation of the blood, sucking (milk), digestion, excretion (albeit some of them, like digestion, needed a bit of practice to work well!) ‚Äì but most musculoskeletal movement was random and you could not control it. It usually takes up to fifteen months of extraordinary learning to be able to move around on the floor, use your hands with basic dexterity, stand and ultimately be mobile on two legs. And the learning goes on for the whole of your life. Compare that to any other creature that is born already wired in such a way that it can run, slide, hop, fly, swim, in a fraction of the time ‚Äì sometimes pretty much immediately after birth ‚Äì or it will starve, get left behind or become someone else‚Äôs lunch. Human beings have to go through a lengthy process of development. It‚Äôs not some pre-programmed process that simply unfolds in us over a specific time frame either. Rather, we develop through our interaction with others and the world: a very complex, personal process within a specific environment.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn15" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn15" class="calibre6">15</a></sup> Let‚Äôs see an example‚Ä¶</p>
<p class="indent">I have one such moment caught very beautifully on camera from a project I did filming babies for the first fifteen months of their lives. In this moment the baby (two months old) is lying on his back on a mat and I have placed a toy strategically on the floor where he can see it, somewhere a little bit away from one side of his head. At this point all this baby can do is wave his arms and legs in a kind of random movement, but he can track with his eyes, focus on things nearby, and turn his head intentionally. The random movement of his arms eventually means that he hits the toy. His attention is caught. He has felt himself touch the toy and out of the corner of his eye has seen the toy wobble. In short, something he has done has made something happen in the world, and he has felt and recognised it. <i class="calibre8">Exciting!</i> He wants to do it again. You can see it. He has turned his head and is looking at the toy and the waving becomes a little more frantic. But he cannot control his arm to make it touch the toy <a id="page_36" class="calibre6"></a>again. Then suddenly, accidentally (but maybe a little less accidentally this time?): bingo. He hits the toy. It wobbles. He is still looking at it. Everything is going manically now because he can‚Äôt limit his movements, prioritise or direct them. Everything is engaged, legs, arms, all waving. Once more: bingo. This time the toy falls over. <i class="calibre8">Wow!</i> And again. And again. And gradually you can see how the randomness is becoming a little less random, a little more directed. Head, eye, hand are beginning to coordinate to make something happen that he wants to happen. He is learning. His system is recognising the sensation of those movements, seeking to reproduce the parts of the movement that go towards achieving his intention, and eliminating the parts of the movement that are not effective or useful. Through this process, he begins to learn to direct his hand and arm more and more not just to hit but even to grab the toy. <i class="calibre8">And get it into his mouth!</i> Over the next few weeks he develops and refines. He adds other new skills he is learning with his foot and pelvis that enable him to shift his weight a bit so his arm can reach better or he can reach with both arms. He establishes a useful pattern of rolling, reaching and grabbing that he can repeat and repeat. The more the pattern is repeated, the more it is wired in.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn16" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn16" class="calibre6">16</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">This very creative process in a child leads to many repeatable discoveries, and in so doing ‚Äòripens‚Äô the nervous system; prioritising some connections, pruning away others; developing how the child moves, acts, responds; establishing patterns of movement, expectation and behaviour specific to that child created through its interaction with the world. Renowned developmental expert (and Feldenkrais practitioner) Esther Thelen did some excellent research in this area, and wrote most elegantly about how the child‚Äôs abilities and sense of self emerge together through this interaction with the world: a combination of impulse, intention, accident, experiment, improvisation and discovery. Interestingly, Esther Thelen compares this kind of learning to the activity of a jazz performer,<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn17" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn17" class="calibre6">17</a></sup> but we could equally compare it to that of an actor. I said this description <a id="page_37" class="calibre6"></a>would contain the fundamentals of the Feldenkrais Method ‚Äì well, there it is right there: that creative process of organic learning that we all engaged in as children (and still do) is at its heart which, in turn, links directly to an actor‚Äôs process too.</p>
<p class="noindent">But all in good time.</p>
<p class="indent">To go back to where we were: this process of development defines us as astonishing learners and extremely adaptable to our surroundings, but that brings with it difficulties as well as advantages. Shout at this same child when he reaches for the toy and he will flinch. His stomach muscles will contract, his arms will be thrown outwards, he will go into the ‚Äòstartle response‚Äô or ‚ÄòMoro reflex‚Äô, which is one of the few things deeply wired in from the start.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn18" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn18" class="calibre6">18</a></sup> Do that every time he goes to reach for the toy and it will begin to affect his pattern of reaching. Very likely he will no longer want to reach for the toy at all. But if he does, that glorious, pleasurable, lengthening movement he was developing is likely to be compromised by the anticipation of danger. As he starts to lengthen to reach for the toy, his system will be contradicting the movement already by contracting in fearful anticipation. What happens if this becomes wired in? It is likely to become an unconscious part of his pattern of reaching unless he has enough other kinds of experience to teach him something different again.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn19" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn19" class="calibre6">19</a></sup> Moshe Feldenkrais called it ‚Äòcross-motivation‚Äô,<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn20" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn20" class="calibre6">20</a></sup> and we will come back to it. But learning can be affected in many ways. What if there was no toy there and nothing to catch his interest? What if he was kept for very long periods of time in a buggy or a bouncy chair? What if he had to compete for that toy with other children all the time? His sensory-motor learning might well be different again.</p>
<p class="indent">And in this way we are the sum of our learning. Watch two children over time and you will see how differently they shape up: what space they are in; what is around them; what they are allowed to do; the family or people they are interacting with; those people‚Äôs involvement, lack of involvement, expectations, warmth, coldness, desires, interests; what the results of the <a id="page_38" class="calibre6"></a>child‚Äôs explorations and attempts are; how safe the child is to try things out or not to ‚Äì it all has its effect on what and how they learn in complicated, profound and detailed ways, that layer up and integrate and are not easily teased apart, analysed or simply codified. This is how we piece together and wire-in our first ways of operating in the world. And we don‚Äôt stop learning at fifteen months. We go on all our life learning different skills; not learning others; giving things up; discovering others; getting frightened or nervous in some areas of life or developing confidence in others; rushing excitedly into some activities, shunning others; wanting to be seen in one way and not another, to be acceptable to this group and not seen as part of that; experiencing trauma, difficulty, upset, comfort and pleasure in different degrees and ways; learning, relearning. All of it creates patterns of behaviour that are held in our nervous system and show up in the base level of tension (tonus), timing and organisation of our skeletal neuromuscular system, i.e. the way we stand, breathe, shake hands, reach, laugh, walk, sit. And when you come into the room, onstage or on to set, you bring all that with you whether you like it or not. Because you are a human being. And that is fine. But you are not and never will be a blank sheet of paper on which to draw a character ‚Äì and nor do you need to be. The really important question is, ‚ÄòHow much do you actually know about what you are bringing with you? Do you know what you do?‚Äô Because if you don‚Äôt know much, what kind of choice can you make about it? How can you improve your skills or start to work with what you could do differently?</p>
<p class="h"><a id="page_39" class="calibre1"></a>Do You Really Know What You Do?</p>
<p class="noindent">Of course, all of us know something of this, and you more than most probably because (I assume if you are reading this) you are an actor or have an interest in acting, and it is an actor‚Äôs job to embody someone else with their different patterns and habits. Besides, even a child knows it‚Äôs fun to point out or copy someone else because they do something in a different way; every teenager knows there is a cool way and a less cool way to walk. But look again at the baby‚Äôs behaviour: we often forget or don‚Äôt really appreciate just how deep that goes, just how complex and layered it is, the amount of tiny detail involved, how little we are aware of our own patterns and just what they say about us.</p>
<p class="indent">It still surprises me how many young actors turn up at drama school and are shocked at how much time movement classes take up. I also notice how often experienced actors lose their curiosity about themselves and are happy to ignore movement work other than some fitness training, and only rediscover it if they get injured or develop chronic pain. Indeed, if you are an experienced actor you may be thinking that the Feldenkrais Method isn‚Äôt for you, that you know enough about yourself and your patterns of movement already. But, with respect, no one does. There is too much to know. You may have worked long enough to have got into some ruts, which means you may need this work as much or more than a student. This is a question you can answer to great advantage whatever age you are and however experienced, because we can learn at deeper levels throughout our lives. We can always improve. You can take that as depressing or exciting. As a Feldenkrais practitioner, I find it exhilarating and fascinating because <i class="calibre8">if you know what you do, you can do what you want</i>. Well, maybe not entirely, but if you don‚Äôt know what you do, you can‚Äôt make much of a start. Or at least we can say: the more you know what you do, the more you increase your possibilities.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="page_40" class="calibre1"></a>The Stories Our Patterns Tell</p>
<p class="noindent">It‚Äôs especially important for actors because your patterns are on show, so everyone <i class="calibre8">else</i> will know things about you, or think they do, as soon as they see you. They will recognise your habits whether they realise it or not, and they will make assumptions about you and create stories about you, right or wrong, whether they mean to or not. Because we are wired up to do that too. A baby needs to recognise its mum or whoever is feeding it (apparently it can do that by smell from three days old). It needs to recognise differences in facial ‚Äì and later whole body ‚Äì signals, and it does that from a surprisingly young age.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn21" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn21" class="calibre6">21</a></sup> I would put good money on you being able to recognise a good friend, close relative or lover at the top of the road or pick them out at the train station, even if you can‚Äôt see their face and they are with a bunch of other people dressed very like them. You will also know if it‚Äôs <i class="calibre8">not</i> them too ‚Äì even if the person you are looking at looks, and is dressed, just like them. Because, whether you can articulate any of it or not, something in you knows in real detail exactly how they stand, the precise rhythm of their walk, the manner with which they sweep the hair away from their face, the timing and angle to the turn of their head. And they would recognise you for all the same reasons.</p>
<p class="indent">When you meet someone new it is important to have some idea about them too. You will have an innate sense of what they are like and whether you trust them or not. But there is nothing mystical about it, you are just picking up all sorts of cues and patterns, comparing it to experiences you have had previously and things you already know about people who have similar or contrasting patterns ‚Äì quite possibly without even realising you are doing it. You may be totally wrong, but you are busily engaged in doing it. Conversely, other people will be doing that with you all the time. <i class="calibre8">Especially when you turn up onstage or in a film</i>. You can never entirely control what other people think, but you can have a good go at creating something that you hope <a id="page_41" class="calibre6"></a>communicates the story you want. But to do that you have to know something about what you are doing in the first place. If you don‚Äôt know that, I repeat, you haven‚Äôt got much possibility of doing anything with it.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindentb" id="ind22"><b class="calibre7">The Stories People Tell Without Telling</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1">Go and sit in a caf√© or at the bus station or in the park, or wherever you like that‚Äôs public and where you can do so without being too easily noticed (and punched!). Just watch someone for a while and notice what assumptions you make about them and why. What‚Äôs the story you have about them? You‚Äôll have one. Or several. And they won‚Äôt be random. You will have reasons if you ask yourself where you are getting them from. What is it about their physicality ‚Äì not just their clothes, age, hairstyle, accessories ‚Äì that gives you clues?</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Then watch someone and try <i class="calibre8">not</i> to make any stories or have any assumptions about them. Make yourself watch them for a good five minutes. It‚Äôs pretty hard not to have <i class="calibre8">any</i> idea about them at all.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">An example: a young actress has a slight tendency to sink in the top ribs at the front just under the collarbone. It makes her look a little round-shouldered. It gives her a slightly unconfident, vulnerable, self-protected look. Surprisingly, a director casts her as Lady Macbeth. She is very excited. It‚Äôs unusual casting for her, but the director is interested in exploring a less traditional, more fragile Lady M. It‚Äôs an example of her unconscious pattern transmitting something that gets her the job, so it‚Äôs not a bad thing altogether. However, there are moments when the director does want her to find a flash of real power. ‚ÄòYou need to really take your ground at this point. Stand tall,‚Äô she says to the actress. The actress cranks herself up by lifting her lower ribs at the front and arching her lower back more, which just makes her look a little chesty and tight and cut off in the waist. ‚ÄòNo, no. Pull <a id="page_42" class="calibre6"></a>your shoulders back,‚Äô says the director. The actress duly pulls her shoulders back. Her collarbones pull tight across the front of her chest, her back is stiff and her throat is compressed. The top ribs are still sinking and it‚Äôs hard to talk properly. ‚ÄòNo no. Relax more!‚Äô the director tells her. She sags. Internally, the director begins to question the wisdom of her casting.</p>
<p class="indent">The thing is that our actress can‚Äôt feel enough of what she is doing to learn to modify it, and the director can‚Äôt help her. She may have been told all the way through drama school that her ‚Äòposture isn‚Äôt good‚Äô, and may even have done quite a lot of exercises to improve aspects of it, but she still doesn‚Äôt really know what it is she is doing. Opening the top ribs is not the same as pulling the shoulders back and it‚Äôs not the same as arching the lower back, but as she can‚Äôt feel what her ribs and shoulders have got to do with each other, or what either have to do with her pelvis, she can‚Äôt begin to explore those relationships and find anything new. Until that point it will affect her casting and, perhaps more importantly, her range and skill within that casting.</p>
<p class="indent">So now I am hoping we have established that you have deeply complex patterns and habits and that, as an actor, you could always benefit from being more aware of them. The next question is, how does the Feldenkrais Method help you do that? And no doubt the question after that is going to be, ‚ÄòAnd what can I do with them and about them?‚Äô Because as we have seen, not all habits are useful (as with this young actress and with that poor baby we imagined earlier who learnt to contract every time he tried to lengthen and reach), and because you want to be able to have more control over what you do and how you come across. Ultimately, you want to find some new/different possibilities to increase your range. Well, as it happens, that is exactly what the Method can enable you to do better.</p>
<p class="indent">But first things first.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_43" class="calibre6"></a>Some preliminaries for all the Feldenkrais lessons in the book:</p>
<p class="list"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Find yourself somewhere warm enough and/or wear something that won‚Äôt let you get too cold from lying still.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> If you know you find the floor too hard to lie on (on your back), get a mat or blanket or make sure you have a nice carpet under you. But not a mattress or the sofa ‚Äì if it is too soft, you sink in too much to be able to feel the things I‚Äôm going to ask.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> If your head is uncomfortably tilted back when you lie on your back, put a folded towel or blanket under it, but not so much that you push your chin too far forward or into your throat.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> If your back is very arched and feels uncomfortable when you lie on your back with your legs long, roll up a blanket and put it under your knees to keep them a bit bent (usually, the bigger the roller, the more it takes the arch out of your back). Or bend your knees and plant your feet (you won‚Äôt get the same information with your feet in this position, though), or just do it for a short while and do some more later. Or don‚Äôt do it at all!</p>
<p class="list"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> If anything actually hurts, <i class="calibre8">stop</i>. Get up. Change position. Do something to relieve it. Pain is a signal that your system reckons what you are doing isn‚Äôt safe for you. Listen to it and act on it. For some people, just lying on the floor is problematic. I‚Äôm not there so I can‚Äôt know how it is for you, and even if I was it is part of the Method that you begin to listen to yourself and learn to look after yourself.</p>
<p class="list"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> You might even want to record the lessons so you can listen rather than have to handle the book at the same time. You can then switch the recording on and off for pauses as required. The lessons vary in length and will take anything from about 5‚Äì45 minutes.</p>
<div class="boxl">
<p class="h1" id="ind26"><a id="page_44" class="calibre1"></a><i class="calibre4">Lesson 1: Basic Awareness</i></p>
<p class="noindentb1">Earlier, I asked you to see if you knew all sorts of things about how you walk. It‚Äôs actually extremely complex to have even a half-accurate answer to that. So here we will go right back to something much simpler: <i class="calibre8">How do you lie on the floor?</i> I‚Äôm serious. Most Feldenkrais classes start with some version of this and keep coming back to it to feel what‚Äôs changing as the lesson progresses. Everyone lies on the floor differently, and because you are lying down you have plenty of sensory information from your contact with the ground to help you feel how you are doing it.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Lie on your back. Legs long if you can. Take your attention into yourself. Listen in. Ask yourself: which parts of you lean on the floor most?</i></p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Probably somewhere in your pelvis for a start.</i> But where? To the left, the right, higher, lower? Is the pressure comfortable or uncomfortable? Is it all in one place or spread? It is unlikely to be bang in the middle and totally evenly spread: no one is completely symmetrical. If I had a pound for every time someone comes into my studio and tells me they have been told their pelvis is ‚Äòout of alignment‚Äô I would be a very rich woman, because everyone‚Äôs is. It‚Äôs a just a question of how, how much and whether the person can function effectively. So, in what way is your pelvis asymmetrical? You will find the answer if you listen carefully enough.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">How about the back of the ribs</i>? Because that‚Äôs the next place that will probably lean most on the floor. But again, where? If the pelvis is asymmetrical, chances are your chest will be too, though not necessarily in the same way. What presses most? Up near your neck? Lower down your back? Left? Right? It may be hard to tell, depending on how easy you find it to listen in. Listening/feeling is a skill that takes time to develop. You may have it already or you may need to do this a lot to develop it. But everyone can improve and notice finer and finer details.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">How about your shoulders?</i> This might be easier. Does one feel closer to the ground or just different in some way?</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><a id="page_45" class="calibre6"></a><i class="calibre8">Your head?</i> Does it lean higher on the back of your skull or lower? Left? Right? Probably one ear is closer to the ground than the other. One ear might be closer to one shoulder than the other too. It‚Äôs not always easy to tell but have a go. Touch your ears if you need to: measure the distance with your hands.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">In between these places that lean heavily are other places in your back that either lean less or don‚Äôt touch at all.</i></p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Your lower back</i>. It arches when you stand. It should do. But lying on the floor it can let go of some of the work involved in arching; it can lengthen and come closer to the floor. It might even touch, but often not. Can you get a sense of how long, how high the arch in your back is? It might even be different on the right side and the left. It‚Äôs harder to get a sense of the places for which you don‚Äôt have the sensory feedback from contact with the floor. You have to develop your proprioceptive skills, i.e. your ability to feel yourself (see <a href="chapter_09_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#6LJU0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 1b</a> for an explanation) ‚Äì but you can do it. <i class="calibre8">The other place is your neck</i>. That is unlikely to touch. But you may still be able to get a sense of how steep or gentle the arch in your neck is by feeling where it starts in your back and where your head leans.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Then how about your legs?</i> Your right and left leg will not be the same, I can promise you. The differences may be small or large. Listen to your heels and notice if the place they lean is different ‚Äì more on the inside or outside? You may then find that the same is true for the whole of your leg. How much of your leg touches? Somewhere in the calf, probably, but behind the knee and behind the ankle there are usually gaps unless you have the leg really on its side, and sometimes the gap behind the knee can extend a long way up the thigh. How wide apart do you have your legs?</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Arms</i>? Do you have your hands palm up, down, on the side? What parts of the arms touch? What is the difference between them? How far away from your side do you like to have them? Maybe you haven‚Äôt even put them on the ground but somewhere on your torso. Your choice won‚Äôt be random. It will be what feels comfortable or familiar ‚Äì unless you have been <a id="page_46" class="calibre6"></a>taught a specific way that you feel is ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô (which for now you should abandon so you can learn about yourself instead).</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">By now you may be feeling quite lopsided and weird.</i> Welcome to the real world! This is how we are. Maybe you feel curious and interested, or maybe it‚Äôs frustratingly difficult to feel what is going on at all. If so, don‚Äôt give up. It takes time to learn a skill and it may get easier later on or if you find a class. So then, what do we do with this? Can we do anything to feel different/better/more even? Yes, of course. But that‚Äôs to come. This is just for starters in order to have a go at feeling something of how you actually are. So for now, stand up and see how you feel in standing. Maybe the same as before. Maybe heavier, lighter, taller, shorter, with more weight on this foot, more on the other, more balanced or just inexplicably not quite the same.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Even just doing something as simple as this and not moving at all may make standing and moving a different experience, as all the patterns you began to notice on the floor are present in everything you do. But, of course, doing something with them is going to take us a great deal further‚Ä¶</p>
