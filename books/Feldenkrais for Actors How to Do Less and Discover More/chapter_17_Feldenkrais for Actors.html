<p class="chaptitle"><a id="page_157" class="calibre1"></a>4a. The Physiology of Emotion</p>
<p class="noindent">For actors, being as emotionally open as they need to be for some roles can be a big issue. As Ute Hagen says, sometimes the kinds of feelings the actor is more used to and feels comfortable with are reasonably accessible, but when the actor feels under pressure to produce something less familiar or more extreme it can get difficult.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn73" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn73" class="calibre6">73</a></sup> And, of course, in the business, conditions are not necessarily conducive. I have my own experiences that I know most actors will recognise, such as being required to break down in a scene on a long-running television series where the regulars were so bored they were playing jokes on the crew until the moment the camera rolled; doing the same show on stage over a long period; or playing a romantic scene on green (blue in those days!) screen with your scene partner represented by a cross on a stick. How do you find something that is believable, appropriate and effective in whatever way it needs to be in each situation? Every time. You can sometimes experience a rush of spontaneous feeling that seems powerful or ‚Äòtrue‚Äô and that connects with the audience, but for many such a feeling is random or even elusive.</p>
<p class="indent">The focus of acting teaching and techniques tends therefore to be on how to trigger an emotional response that reads as ‚Äòtrue‚Äô (without being overwhelmed or losing the context of what is needed for the scene) and on what you can do to find it ‚Äì and <a id="page_158" class="calibre6"></a>find it repeatedly. There are methods that many actors find extremely useful in that arena, while others just find their own blend or their own way. I am not in the business of proposing a particular acting technique ‚Äì and I can appreciate the benefits of many diverse acting theories ‚Äì but I would like to look at what is involved in emotions and feelings, and how the Feldenkrais Method can facilitate a better understanding for an actor to enhance whatever process works for you.</p>
<p class="h">Mental or Physical?</p>
<p class="noindent">In my experience, the idea that feeling or emotion is purely or primarily a mental act (something that happens in your head) is still a prevalent ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô view. It doesn‚Äôt take much to point out that when you are sad, you cry, and when you are happy, you laugh ‚Äì but these are often seen in a very limited way as physical manifestations secondary to a fundamentally mental state. As an actor you need a better understanding in order to be more emotionally available on stage, whenever you need. In every feeling state ‚Äì whether that means the big emotions like anger, sadness, euphoric happiness, fear, anxiety, or the little fluctuations we make between alertness and relaxation, nervousness and confidence, contentment and dis-ease ‚Äì there are shifts and changes throughout your physiology affecting breathing, heart rate, blood flow, the tonus of muscles, guts, and even sometimes the immune system.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindentb" id="ind19"><a id="page_159" class="calibre6"></a><b class="calibre7">The Sensation of Emotion</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Stand and listen to how you are for a moment. Pay attention to your sensations ‚Äì</i> the tensions you can currently feel in yourself, where your weight is on your feet and how you are breathing ‚Äì so you would notice if something changed.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Bring up a memory of something that made you angry (not overwhelmingly, just enough to do this and come out of it easily) and notice what alters in the musculature of your face, your neck and shoulders, chest, belly, legs. What alters in your breathing, your heart rate, in the way you give your weight to the ground? Let the feeling go and feel what shifts back again as you do so (sometimes easier).</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Bring up something sad and notice what alters (again do not seek to be overwhelmed ‚Äì just a taste). You may have more tension or less tension, lightness or heaviness, a different quality to your breath or other kinds of shifts to listen to. And listen to what reverts when you let it go.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">It is usually enough to feel these emotions physically to understand what I am saying, but more subtle changes happen with every slight shift in mood, and if you train yourself to listen you will hear them in finer detail. There are other physiological changes happening that you cannot feel, but you can at least pay attention to the sensations that are available.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">There is still no cut-and-dried explanation of the exact mechanics of emotion, and more and more factors are being recognised as significant, but over time the model has shifted towards a complex but holistic combination of neurophysical and mental processes.</p>
<p class="indent">It has also been established that the physical aspects of emotion are not necessarily subsequent to mental activity. In fact, it might be the other way around: butterflies in the stomach remind us we are nervous or excited; a sick feeling or racing heart tells us we are anxious or fearful. The physical aspect of emotion is obviously useful for communicating how we are feeling to <a id="page_160" class="calibre6"></a>others, but feelings and emotions also alert us to situations and conditions that we need to take notice of as calls to action for our protection and survival:<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn74" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn74" class="calibre6">74</a></sup> fear, anxiety and nervousness direct us away from danger or invite caution; pleasure and excitement direct us towards something for our well-being; anger and confidence enable us to face difficulty and danger or ward it off. Indeed, the word emotion is derived from the Latin ‚Äò<i class="calibre8">e</i>‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòout of, away from‚Äô, and ‚Äò<i class="calibre8">movere</i>‚Äô, meaning ‚Äòto move‚Äô. Often a strong emotion can only be discharged through activity, be it running, fighting, throwing, speaking one‚Äôs mind, crying, laughing, singing, dancing, making love or whatever.</p>
<p class="indent">The understanding of emotion as a physical event has been explored by thinkers from Charles Darwin through William James, Antonio Damasio, Nico Fridja and more, and is now widely accepted. Frijda states: ‚ÄòEmotions are‚Ä¶ matters of the body: of the heart, the stomach and intenstines, of bodily activity and impulse. They are of the flesh and sear the flesh. Also they are of the brain and the veins.‚Äô</p>
<p class="indent">And Moshe Feldenkrais asks:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindentl">Which comes first ‚Äì the motor pattern or the feeling? The question has been the object of many famous theories. I stress the view that basically they form a single function. We cannot become conscious of a feeling before it is expressed by a motor mobilisation, and, therefore, there is no feeling so long as there is no body attitude.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn75" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn75" class="calibre6">75</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">At least one idea about acting is that it involves a kind of transparency: the actor transmits what they feel on the inside to the outside, and the actor‚Äôs physicality needs to be fluid enough to enable that: not to create blocks. This dualistic image works and can be useful in a simple sense. An actor does indeed ‚Äòmake visible the invisible‚Äô, as Peter Brook suggests. One could go further and say there is no inside to outside, it is all one thing. Each feeling, each emotion, each current that passes through us is a unified <a id="page_161" class="calibre6"></a>event of the whole person. There has also been a far more facile argument over the years that has sought to separate actors who work from the ‚Äòoutside in‚Äô from those who work from the ‚Äòinside out‚Äô. Perhaps we can finally lay that false dichotomy to rest.</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindentl">I‚Ä¶ say that there is no identity. I say there is only one thing. There is a functioning nervous system inside, and that functioning has two aspects. If you listen to someone, you see the motor aspect and you also perceive the mental aspect (the content of his words). Any change in the nervous system translates itself clearly through a change of attitude, posture and muscular configuration. They are not two states but two aspects of the same state.</p>
<p class="right"><i class="calibre8">Moshe Feldenkrais</i><sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn76" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn76" class="calibre6">76</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Whatever the exact mechanics and dynamics of how we experience emotions ‚Äì which are still being argued over and pieced together in our brave new age of neurophysiology ‚Äì the total involvement of a person‚Äôs system in an emotional event is not in doubt.</p>
<p class="h">Habits of Feeling</p>
<p class="noindent">Feldenkrais said he was after more flexible minds, not more flexible bodies. Given the unity of mental and motor expressed above, he argued that it was easier to enable a person to change as a result of the shifts that occur spontaneously while exploring movement and sensation, rather than through an intellectual approach which directly engages a person in their habitual responses and patterns of thought. Over the years of doing Functional Integration (the hands-on technique in the Feldenkrais Method), I have learnt to see and feel under my hands the way a person‚Äôs sensory-motor patterns are part and parcel of their emotional habits ‚Äì their view of themselves and <a id="page_162" class="calibre6"></a>the world, their expectations, their habitual responses, their persistent patterns of feeling ‚Äì some more enabling, some more disabling, depending on their experiences of life. I may not know the actual ‚Äòstory‚Äô of what happened or have a hotline to their thoughts, but I can feel their patterns of tension and breathing. It goes back yet again to the baby in <a href="chapter_07_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#4OIQ0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 1</a> and will recur in <a href="chapter_18_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#F8900-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 4b</a> to come. We learn our ways of moving, our ways of feeling and being, and our patterns of responding (be they physical or emotional), all together. It‚Äôs complex and individual, and there is no instruction book of ‚Äòthis means that‚Äô and ‚Äòthat means that‚Äô‚Äì but you can see and feel the difference in breath, in muscle tone, in stance, even in someone‚Äôs eyes and voice when there is a shift in how they feel. And vice versa, when the person senses a physical shift, the way they are feeling almost always shifts with it.</p>
<p class="indent">An extreme example is a very intelligent young man who came to see me who had a history of anger and violence that was serious enough to have landed him in prison. Although always polite to me, his past was very present in the high level of tension he carried: in his hawkish posture, his swift, sharp movements, his piercing gaze and his hyper-alert state. I only knew fragments of his story but I could see and feel it too. The few Feldenkrais sessions we did brought his system into a place where he looked more upright, more open and softer, and he was able to feel more at one with himself and at ease. He told me with pleasure that after a session people didn‚Äôt cross the road when they saw him coming; that a woman had even initiated a conversation with him at the bus stop; and that he didn‚Äôt feel the same need to get angry with his neighbour.</p>
<p class="indent">So perhaps we can say we have habits of feeling as much as we have habits of moving, breathing, speaking and holding ourselves. Some of us, like this young man, can fall into a pattern of anger easily, but perhaps not a pattern of tenderness or of sadness. Others may find anger almost impossible to access. As Ute Hagen says, familiar and/or less threatening feelings and <a id="page_163" class="calibre6"></a>emotions will be easy for an actor to access and use. Others are not so familiar ‚Äì not so habitual, we could say ‚Äì or feel threatening in some way, and so are harder to access. Her suggestion is to recall a time when such an emotion was felt and seek for the associated sense (affect) memory (the associated smell or sound or small visual detail perhaps) that escaped the ‚Äòcensor‚Äô (the part of yourself that has repressed it), and so could trigger the release of the emotion that has been repressed. Memory is indeed not stored all in one place in the brain but in many places in relation to our senses, any piece of which can bring the whole flooding back, including its emotional content. But some feelings can be very well defended, depending on the person‚Äôs life experiences, and we have to respect that that might actually be for very good reasons. As our patterns of feeling are part and parcel of our motor patterns, it‚Äôs also possible to approach them through the sensory-motor system without having to remember events of any kind, and it can happen without directly trying. Some of the habits of tension (or ‚Äòholding‚Äô) that we learn to recognise and open up through Feldenkrais lessons, are likely to be part of defensive patterns which will gradually loosen their compulsive grip. This happens as it becomes safe to do so, because other more functional patterns become available and eventually preferred. In this way it often happens that a wider palate of feeling and emotion becomes safely available too. It can simply help with whatever other process you are using too.</p>
<p class="indent">For an actor, using Feldenkrais to develop a more sensitive, more fluid system, less bound by compulsive habits, is also likely to be enabling in terms of allowing emotional or mental shifts. It doesn‚Äôt mean if you can do the splits you are a higher form of life ‚Äì let‚Äôs be very clear about that ‚Äì because I am not talking about that kind of flexibility. It means if you are able to feel, allow, adapt and respond in a variety of ways, not just in limited compulsive habitual patterns, it will affect your emotional and mental potential. I will have more to say about how reason and thinking are shaped by movement and our bodily <a id="page_164" class="calibre6"></a>sensation in <a href="chapter_18_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#F8900-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 4b</a>, but all of it harks back to that very first example of the baby in <a href="chapter_07_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#4OIQ0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 1</a>. How we learn to move and sense ourselves is shaped by our experience as well as our genetic make-up. By extension, how we learnt to move and sense ourselves ‚Äì our self-image ‚Äì will keep shaping how we think, feel and experience ourselves and the world. That‚Äôs the big picture that Feldenkrais addresses, and another reason why it is such a fruitful study for an actor who wishes to bring to life another character‚Äôs way of thinking, feeling and experiencing themselves and the world.</p>
<p class="indent">Everything we have seen so far in terms of working with patterns and habits applies here too. As well as asking how you can make an emotion come up, you can also why it isn‚Äôt coming up ‚Äì what is getting in the way. Once again you can ask what you can do <i class="calibre8">less</i> in order that you have more available as an actor.</p>
<p class="indent">Most of the great teachers and theoreticians came to the same conclusion as Stanislavky, that: ‚Äòmuscular tautness interferes with inner emotional experience‚Äô.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn77" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn77" class="calibre6">77</a></sup> For instance, here is Michael Chekhov: ‚ÄòEvery actor, to a greater or lesser degree, suffers from some of the body‚Äôs resistance‚Äô;<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn78" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn78" class="calibre6">78</a></sup> or Sanford Meisner: ‚ÄòNeutral: what does that mean? Open to any influence right? If you are neutral you will achieve a kind of emotional flexibility won‚Äôt you? If you‚Äôre tense, if you‚Äôre unrelaxed, you‚Äôre not responsive.‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn79" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn79" class="calibre6">79</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Many teachers and theoreticians have their versions of ‚Äòrelaxation‚Äô exercises to get around the problem of habitual tension. However, ‚Äòrelaxation techniques‚Äô or stretching exercises, while helpful, are sometimes too general to address our very deep unconscious patterns of holding, especially when it comes to the ones that involve emotional responses. The Feldenkrais Method offers some more sophisticated options.</p>
<p class="indent">There is a sense in which tension is part of feeling. The level of tension you feel when you are excited or angry, alert, depressed, determined, frightened or contented is different because the motor aspect of all these emotions is different. (Jacques Lecoq‚Äôs ‚ÄòSeven Levels of Tension‚Äô plays with this idea <a id="page_165" class="calibre6"></a>going from being almost inert with flaccidity to being immobilised by tension, each of which suggest a different way of being.) In terms of emotion, some aspects of tension are not really part of the emotion itself but result from the effort we use to stop the feeling flowing into action ‚Äì or even to stop the feeling itself. Here is a version of a Stanislavsky exercise that illustrates this.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindentb" id="ind7"><b class="calibre7">Feeling and Tension</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Stand for a moment and bring up a memory of some tender moment.</i> Someone you love arriving or departing, or some gentle, happy or nostalgic time. Listen again to the kinds of changes in your physicality that you can perceive, as in the previous game. Listen very carefully. Now let it go and listen to what reverts.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">And now imagine you are on the motorway with a couple of mates and you have a puncture.</i> The tyre has to be changed, but your friend (whose car it is) doesn‚Äôt have a jack. Two of you will have to hold the car up while your friend changes the tyre (yes, it‚Äôs possible, I‚Äôve been in this situation on tour!). Do the action of lifting the car. It‚Äôs very, very heavy. You have to make a great effort and strain hard. While you are in that state of immense strain, try to bring up the soft tender feeling you had a moment ago. Can you do it? Let the car go.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Unless you are a well-trained martial artist who doesn‚Äôt include tensing and straining in their image of lifting the car, you most likely struggled to bring up the tender emotion. Notice that it‚Äôs not just that you couldn‚Äôt portray it at the same time as straining, it is very likely that you couldn‚Äôt even feel it. I‚Äôve done this many, many times with many groups and the result is always the same. So now: ‚ÄòWhich comes first, the motor pattern or the feeling?‚Äô</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_166" class="calibre6"></a>To come back to our one event that is both mental and physical at the same time, it may not be the case that the feeling is inside but blocked and so can‚Äôt travel from inside to outside: it may not be to do with the actor‚Äôs transparency and not being seen from the outside ‚Äì it may be that it <i class="calibre8">can‚Äôt be felt at all</i>. When you are sad or frightened and you want to cry or scream, what is it that you do to stop the sadness or fear? One way is to tighten up to stop the physiological process, so that all you can feel is the tension of the muscles in your chest or diaphragm or stomach or wherever, and not the sadness or the fear. It is that strain and effort that we see when we say someone is ‚Äòholding something in‚Äô, but as in straining to lift the car, the tension is more likely to be stopping it happening at all. Another way is almost the opposite: a sort of frozen limpness where mind and body are not engaged ‚Äì a kind of dissociation like an animal playing dead. Both involve an inappropriate level of muscular work and stop the feeling happening, in the same way that blocking your ears stops you hearing or closing your eyes stops you seeing.</p>
<p class="indent">A final example: what do you do to stop yourself being angry? If you can‚Äôt let it out in some active way, you might try and reason yourself out of it ‚Äì and if you are successful you will feel all the physical effects subside. However, you might well hold yourself even tighter to suppress the feeling. If you can, you might take deep breaths and let go of the tension, in which case the softening is likely to take away not just the display of anger, but the anger itself.</p>
<p class="indent">Sometimes the way you suppress the emotion is a conscious choice even if the mechanism isn‚Äôt. Sometimes it happens without you even trying or perhaps knowing, because your system senses it is not safe or that you could be overwhelmed. The latter is part of the mechanism that comes into play in serious trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder, but you can also see it when people say ‚Äòit hasn‚Äôt hit me yet‚Äô, in those moments you swallow or shelve the little insults and upsets of the day because it is just not useful or the right moment to allow yourself to feel <a id="page_167" class="calibre6"></a>or deal with them ‚Äì and then you just never actually come back to deal with them. Indeed, you may not even notice you do it.</p>
<p class="indent">What does all this mean for you as an actor? It means you have patterns of holding tension that affect your movement and also have to do with controlling emotion. It means excessive strain and effort get in the way of finding easy, fluid, nuanced patterns of <i class="calibre8">feeling</i>, as well as moving. It means that if you dig deep and wind yourself up, pushing yourself to find a pitch of emotion you think you need for a scene, you are likely to add more tension and actually make it harder for yourself to feel anything (as Ute Hagen would agree). In addition, as we saw in the section on <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i>, the tension and the internal effort may cut you off from what is really going on between you and the other actors in the scene ‚Äì which, ironically, is likely to be the very source of what truly enables the flow of something appropriate to the moment. The emotional tenor of the scene is not just your responsibility and a result of your internal work alone, but grows in the space between the actors when there is openness, connection and <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i>. So ultimately it means that once your compulsive patterns lose their grip a little ‚Äì once you can develop alternatives and a wider range of possibilities, once you can safely be more open ‚Äì all you need is to know the circumstances of your character and the scene, and be fully present with the other actors in order to open up the space for whatever is needed to flow between you ‚Äì be that jokes, tears, anger or tenderness.</p>
<p class="indent">I mentioned earlier Feldenkrais‚Äôs notion that when you only have one option you are an automaton; two and you are at the level of a light switch; more than two and you become human. Clearly, ‚Äòhuman‚Äô is where an actor needs to be. Once they have come out of the initial trance-like state some Feldenkrais lessons can induce, actors can often access themselves and be more emotionally open and responsive to others. A Feldenkrais lesson lowers the overall level of intensity. It provides support in the system to lower the defences enough for something to happen. <a id="page_168" class="calibre6"></a>It allows the actor to take the foot safely off the brake.</p>
<p class="indent">There is research becoming available on this idea. Norman Doidge notes: ‚ÄòWhen people feel safe, the parasympathetic nervous system turns off the fight-or-flight reaction‚Äô;<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn80" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn80" class="calibre6">80</a></sup> and as Stephen Porges has brilliantly demonstrated, the parasympathetic system also turns on a ‚Äòsocial engagement system‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn81" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn81" class="calibre6">81</a></sup>‚Ä¶ allowing people to listen to, communicate and connect with others. Sounds like <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i> to me.</p>
<p class="indent">Think back to the client I mentioned earlier. He was used to people in the street avoiding contact with him and yet after a lesson that was no longer true.</p>
<p class="h">Ebb and Flow</p>
<p class="noindent">Through learning to listen to yourself with increasing accuracy during Awareness Through Movement Lessons (should you pursue the Method), you can learn to feel those shifts and changes in breathing, heart rate and muscular tone, and it can form a background awareness against which you can navigate through a play or find the moment in front of a camera. We discussed awareness in <a href="chapter_10_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#7K4G0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 2</a>, which is not a self-consciousness, but a connectedness to what is going on inside you. It also enables you to sense the ebb and flow of the ‚Äòcurrents‚Äô of feelings and emotions within you: once you have a sense of the shape of those currents in a scene or even a whole play, something in you will seek it, shape it from within as you go through the performance. I can still recall Rose of Sharon‚Äôs empty despair towards the end of <i class="calibre8">Grapes of Wrath</i>, which I played thirty years ago. But as I remember the scene, what I notice is the sensation in my belly, chest, jaw and throat ‚Äì down my arms, behind my eyes and what it does to my breathing. Even now. And with that physical sense comes the emotional sense of it. Very different to the feeling of her earlier in the play: perky, spoilt and newly married ‚Äì a light, bright, full, sensual, hips-and-lips kind of sensation. It‚Äôs not that I didn‚Äôt do other <a id="page_169" class="calibre6"></a>kinds of actor prep too, but once I was actually on stage, the changing physical map was always there in the background. Along the same lines, Michael Chekhov invites the actor to take on a physical shape or gesture to find the essence of a character or of a moment, and Ute Hagen invites the actor to become alive to all their senses. Back then I didn‚Äôt use either as a formal technique (in fact, I had never heard of them!), but I still had a sense of the ebb and flow, the shifting shapes and physical feel of the character‚Äôs emotional journey. Feldenkrais can do a great deal to tune you in to that possibility.</p>
<p class="h">Reversibility</p>
<p class="noindent">Once you can sense the physical flow and shape of your states of feeling, it also becomes easier to reverse and switch in and out without getting stuck somewhere. Pretty useful for an actor. I once worked with an actress who used to tell jokes in the dressing room until a few minutes before she went on, then come back in at the end of a highly emotional scene, wiping away tears and running mascara and get straight back to the jokes before her next equally emotional scene. She could do it every time. And most of the (experienced, talented, respected) cast in one long-running play that I was in used to watch <i class="calibre8">Casualty</i> on TV in the green room between scenes, and then go on and give fabulous performances. At the time, I couldn‚Äôt understand how on earth they could do it. Sometimes young actors ‚Äì especially students ‚Äìfall headlong into an emotion, playing it for all they are worth, and end up apparently unable to come out of it. There is a real danger of falling in love with being carried away like this and thinking it‚Äôs the ‚Äòreal deal‚Äô ‚Äì that we must torment ourselves and ‚Äògive our all‚Äô ‚Äì but, as actors become more experienced, they understand that it is the audience who are meant to have the experience, not them: just because an actor felt the earth move, doesn‚Äôt mean the audience did. In fact, quite the opposite sometimes: the actor disappears <a id="page_170" class="calibre6"></a>into a welter of emoting, stumbles off into their own corridor and ends up losing the audience and pulling the play apart.</p>
<p class="indent">Reversibility gives you the facility to shift, change, go in and out, modulate and allow just what is needed to happen ‚Äì no more, no less. You can play this next game in different ways: go into it slowly and out of it fast, or into it fast and out of it slowly, until you have acquired ease and facility.</p>
<p class="indent">As with a Feldenkrais lesson, using just a bit less will give you a better learning experience than trying for something too big. If you are not sure how it will go, make sure someone is with you, so long as you don‚Äôt <i class="calibre8">perform</i> it for them!</p>

<p class="noindentb" id="ind8"><b class="calibre7">Grading and Reversal of Emotion</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Listen how you feel as you stand.</i> Listen to your breathing, heart rate, level of muscle tension in different places, and where your weight is.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Now think of some moment in your past when you were very happy, but don‚Äôt go there yet.</i></p>
<p class="noindentb1">Take five slow steps forward and allow yourself to let that feeling of happiness grow, sensing what changes physically as you go. Allow it to change you physically even if it is not naturalistic. Time it so that you are at the peak of the feeling when you get to step five and stay there for a moment, allowing yourself to feel what it is like: what shape the feeling forms you in to, where your weight is, how your breathing feels, where your level of tension is now. Then take five steps backwards, undoing the physical feeling and shape gradually until the emotion is also gone.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Do the same thing over ten steps, so you have to allow the feeling to grow even more slowly. Stay in contact with the growing physical sensation and shape of it. Then take ten steps back, allowing the physical sensation and shape of the emotion to undo themselves until it is all completely gone.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Try the same with sadness or tenderness, and, if you are feeling brave, you can even try anger. If you do, don‚Äôt allow tension to <a id="page_171" class="calibre6"></a>hold the anger back too much, but be careful. Don‚Äôt pick any memory that could be remotely overwhelming, and stay anchored in your physical sensation. It is very important to be able to take those ten steps back again just as carefully, meticulously undoing the physical sensation completely and noticing how the emotion goes away totally with it. The lesson is all about reversibility and absolutely not about getting stuck in your emotion and showing off how much you can ‚Äòfeel‚Äô.</p>
