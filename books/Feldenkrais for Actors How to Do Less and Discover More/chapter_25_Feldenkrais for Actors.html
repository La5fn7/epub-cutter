<div class="block">
<p class="noindentl">‚ÄòAre there no technical means by which the actor can achieve the creative mood, so that inspiration may appear oftener than is its wont?‚Äô This does not mean that I was going to create inspiration by artificial means. That would be impossible. What I wanted to learn was how to create a favourable condition for the appearance of inspiration by means of the will, that condition in the presence of which inspiration was most likely to descend into the actor‚Äôs soul‚Ä¶</p>
<p class="right"><i class="calibre8">Stanislavsky</i><sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn91" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn91" class="calibre6">91</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Sound familiar? Didn‚Äôt Feldenkrais say he didn‚Äôt <i class="calibre8">teach</i> as much as <i class="calibre8">create the conditions</i> in which people can learn? That‚Äôs the job really. The question of how to teach Feldenkrais to actors and acting students does come up often. Does it need to be done differently in some way? Can you just teach a straightforward ATM or does it need to be framed and contextualised, made more specific, or taught slightly differently or as a part of something else?</p>
<p class="indent">Personally I think most of these approaches can be valid and it depends on the situation and who you are teaching. An actor can just turn up and do an ATM anywhere in any regular class or workshop, and find the gems within it that relate to them and to what they need if they are open and interested. And they do. <a id="page_252" class="calibre6"></a>As Garet Newell said to me, the more you frame a lesson, the more something is lost. And she is right ‚Äì any kind of framework is, by its very nature, limiting. Within that, in the same way that it is possible to teach the same lesson in a public class a number of different ways to bring out different aspects of the lesson, it is possible to teach a lesson in a way that draws attention to aspects that you think will be of particularly of interest to actors.</p>
<p class="indent">It is also possible to design a class or a workshop to address something you consider important for actors and teach your ATMs within that framework (in the much same way you might teach a public workshop on a theme) to help elucidate something, and contextualise it with some activities, observations or games that will enable them to apply what they have found. In the same way, if you are working one-to-one with an actor who has come to prepare for a role, you might frame the lesson around what they are exploring and seek to integrate it into skills they can use at the end. It‚Äôs the same idea that you would apply to anyone who comes for a lesson, class or workshop, just the territory and means of integration may be a little different. For example, I might frame a lesson for a runner with running, or an aspect of running, before and after, so that they notice and integrate whatever they discover. It is also possible to apply Feldenkrais thinking without actually doing a whole ATM in situations where it‚Äôs necessary to work better and more quickly ‚Äì I gave some examples in <a href="chapter_16_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#DB7S0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 4</a>.</p>
<p class="indent">Teaching in drama school is slightly different, though. In that situation you have students who have to be in your class because it is part of the course. They have not chosen to be there, may know nothing about Feldenkrais, and may start without much of an interest in movement or understanding of why it is important for actors. Their purpose in coming to the school is to learn to be an actor and make a good career in the business rather than personal development (although that is an inevitable part of any learning process), but they cannot leave <a id="page_253" class="calibre6"></a>your class if they don‚Äôt find it useful and cannot see its relevance. The onus may be on them to learn, but it is also on you as a teacher to offer them as many ways in to the Method as possible, and to respond to their level of need for a framework which will make it accessible and useable: to create an environment in which they can learn.</p>
<p class="indent">What that environment is will differ. Third years are different to first years, who are different again to post-grads or foundation-course students; music-theatre students are different to acting students; one school is different to another; one group of first years is different to another. How Feldenkrais sits within the school may be different, how integrated it is into the different departments, and how the rest of the staff respond to it and accommodate it will vary. Your position within the school and with those students may make a difference too. All of that has to be taken into account in what you do and may make it easier or harder.</p>
<p class="indent">Your students may be very ‚Äòwith‚Äô you and able to get what they need just from a straightforward series of ATMs. On the other hand, you may find you want to frame what they are doing more or use more games to capture their imaginations or clarify what is useful about the changes that come about in a lesson. You may want to include pair and observational work to give them more ownership of the lessons. Group or pair work can give them the opportunity to see or feel the changes in each other and have their own changes witnessed: it may be that others can see or feel changes in them that they cannot feel in themselves, or they may see or feel changes in others that make them look for those kinds of possibilities in themselves. They may hear difference in their voice before they notice anything else.</p>
<p class="indent">You may want to start with bigger lessons first, in which they can learn to do something like getting up and down from the floor in different ways to challenge them. Discovering that they can learn to do something big like that with considerably more ease, very quickly, will enable them to move on to smaller, more <a id="page_254" class="calibre6"></a>detailed work that takes greater patience and finer levels of sensitivity. You might find you have students with a lot of difficulties on the floor and so you have to stay away from anything challenging for some time, tailoring the work very carefully. You may have a group that is ready to dive right in to highly nuanced work and relish it, or you may want to create situations where they are likely to have very strong experiences to bring the work alive (like the sand boxes). You might want to involve them in an external observational project that relates to a theme you are exploring, so that they are applying what they are discovering in themselves to what they can see in a stranger‚Äôs walk, gestures, presence or behaviour ‚Äì and notice what story they get from that or what parts of it they can in turn try out for themselves. You may be able to relate the lessons to what they need for a show or a project/course they are doing with another teacher, in order to create a context that helps them see how they can use it.</p>
<p class="indent">I have listed just a few possibilities. Most teachers who go to work in drama schools have a performance background so most will have a wealth of ideas of their own to draw on to make it work in their own way. In good Feldenkrais tradition it may take a bit of trial and error. A few ‚Äòapproximations‚Äô. Confidence and experience helps and also knowing that, however well you teach, you can‚Äôt win ‚Äôem all.</p>
<p class="indent">I hope the book offers some food for thought and a few ideas to build on.</p>
