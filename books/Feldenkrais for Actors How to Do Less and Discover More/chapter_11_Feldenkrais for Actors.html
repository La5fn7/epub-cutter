<p class="noindentl">Are you listening to me? Are you really listening to me?‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not pretending that you‚Äôre listening. You‚Äôre really listening. Would you say so?‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs the reality of doing.</p>
<p class="right"><i class="calibre8">Sanford Meisner</i><sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn34" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn34" class="calibre6">34</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">So far we have looked at how the Feldenkrais Method enables you to expand your experience of yourself and develop your range by enabling you to feel what you are doing, explore and discover different possibilities. We started to talk a little about the playful nature of exploring and learning in the Feldenkrais Method and how that is related to the ability to play as an actor. So now I would like to delve a little deeper into a very fundamental aspect of the Method that enables the actor not just to learn but to be ready to play ‚Äì fully engaged, curious and present in the moment.</p>
<p class="h">Being in the Moment</p>
<p class="noindent">When you were doing the lesson at the end of the first part, you were invited to feel what was happening at that moment and to notice the movement as you made it. You didn‚Äôt put your <a id="page_73" class="calibre6"></a>headphones on and zone out while ‚Äòdoing the exercise‚Äô (I hope!). You had to be present, tuned in and listening. I also asked you to feel what was going on <i class="calibre8">as</i> you moved, not just get from point A to point B or achieve a particular position. I invited you to pay attention to what you were doing as you did it and to the subtle variations; to remain ‚Äòpresent‚Äô and ‚Äòin the moment‚Äô all the time, i.e. to actually really do it and engage in doing it. It‚Äôs not always such an easy thing to do without the mind wandering, but it is essential for learning and is actually what you have to do as an actor. Half the job is to stay present, ‚Äòengaged‚Äô in and curious about what is going on all of the time so you have a sense of the possibilities available to you. In life, people often develop an increasingly limited range of movement possibilities, not necessarily because of lack of flexibility but because we tend to stick to well-trodden pathways, and others just fall into disuse. Habits. In a Feldenkrais lesson, people sometimes have an idea of how a specific movement goes at the start, and so they just do that one thing in an automatic way without really engaging in what it is they are doing, and there is no space for a real, fresh, spontaneous ‚Äì and possibly different ‚Äì kind of response. Maybe that‚Äôs the only way they can imagine doing it or maybe they just replay something they did the last time they did this lesson three months ago, six months before or a year before that, in a kind of ‚Äòyes I know, you say lift the arm, I do it like this and it feels like that‚Äô kind of way; or maybe they have an idea of what they think is ‚Äòcorrect.‚Äô But the lesson actually asks them to leave aside their assumptions, get curious about what is involved, as if they have never done it before, and so find something new in it. At the very least the quality of engagement in the movement and the sense of spontaneity becomes very different. In fact, Feldenkrais sometimes offers very novel variations of movements in strange positions, so that it‚Äôs very difficult <i class="calibre8">not</i> to pay attention.</p>
<p class="indent">The same thing happens on set and onstage. An actor can be so busy enacting something according to what they did last <a id="page_74" class="calibre6"></a>time, or some notion of how the character should be, that they are not engaged in what is actually happening <i class="calibre8">now</i> ‚Äì this moment. It makes the difference between the audience being really interested in watching what is going to happen next and the audience getting bored because nothing seems to be going on. Every time we embark on the journey of a Feldenkrais lesson, we practise the same kind of engagement and curiosity that is needed for acting. Something is going to happen: we don‚Äôt know what or certainly we don‚Äôt know how. We may have had experiences of it before, but this is <i class="calibre8">now</i>. We rediscover it anew every single time by simply engaging in what is happening in the moment: not repeating, ‚Äòphoning it in‚Äô, switching off, zoning out or insisting on what we think is correct or is a ‚Äògood idea‚Äô. We really do it, as Meisner says in the quote at the start of this section. And that means we have to be present with and fully engaged in what we are doing, open to possibilities ‚Äì whether making a simple movement in a Feldenkrais lesson or playing King Lear.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindentb" id="ind12"><b class="calibre7">Listening In</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Stand and turn your head to look to the left and right.</i> Just where it goes really easily.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">Did you actually listen to what you were doing when you turned your head? It maybe that if you listen carefully enough you will notice that it turns more easily in one direction than the other, or that you find your eyeline travelling differently ‚Äì maybe higher on one side and lower on the other ‚Äì if you don‚Äôt interfere with it. Turn your head again and see if it is possible to notice any difference in how you turn your head to the left and the right. Already you are probably engaging in the movement differently. You are listening to what you are doing. That may mean your movement already has a different quality.</p>
<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">Keep turning your head gently and slowly only where it rolls easily, but change one thing each time:</i></p>
<p class="listb"><a id="page_75" class="calibre6"></a><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Focus your eyes as if on a ship on the horizon far away. Watch it travel slowly cross the horizon as far to the left as comfortable, and then as far to the right. Notice what it does to how you turn your head and how it feels.</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Now focus your eyes very close as if there is a small creature that is travelling from close to one shoulder, around your face, a smallish distance from the end of your nose and ending up close to the other shoulder. What does it do to the movement of your head? How does it feel?</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Now keep your eyes on a spot in front of you and turn your head ‚Äì but not your eyes. They stay fixed on the spot. What happens to how you can turn your head? What does it feel like?</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Is it possible to turn your head one way and have your eyes look the other way?</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Clamp your jaw really tight shut and turn your head left and right without letting your jaw loosen at all. What happens? How does it feel?</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Have your attention on the journey of the tip of your nose as you turn your head insead (just your attention, not your eyes!), and now on your ears, and now on the back of your head. Notice the differences.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">It probably feels different each time, doesn‚Äôt it? And it probably subtly changes the quality of the movement. It may even suggest a different emotional situation.</p>
<p class="noindentb1">And if you just roll your head simply again at the end, it may roll more easily‚Ä¶</p>
<p class="noindentb1">In this game, just by being present and aware of what is actually happening, you become alive to the rich possibilities of subtle differences and variation available to you in what is essentially a very simple movement. This won‚Äôt be the case if you are in automatic mode or just not able to fully listen to yourself. It is a kind of awareness that connects you to yourself and <a id="page_76" class="calibre6"></a>to the present moment in a way that not only enables you to learn, but has a relation to what you need to do when you act. You are not deciding what to do and doing it; you are discovering possibilities by listening to what is happening at the time.</p>
</div>
<p class="h">Awareness, Self-consciousness and Embodiment</p>
<p class="noindent">An acting student once brought up Meisner in a Feldenkrais lesson ‚Äì and Meisner‚Äôs technique of taking your attention <i class="calibre8">away</i> from yourself rather than focusing on yourself ‚Äì and asked if that didn‚Äôt contradict this use of awareness. But, to me, Meisner is actually saying something very similar in a different way. He is giving you a practical task like repetition in order to stop you consciously thinking and get you to do something fully and respond in the moment. Similar. He is advising against a sort of self-conscious thinking that pulls you out of yourself and out of the moment. Similar. He wants you to really <i class="calibre8">do</i> something as opposed to pretend to do it or act out an idea about how a character would do it. Same. The opposite of Meisner‚Äôs reality of doing is a kind of separation from yourself by conscious thinking which I would describe as not being connected to, and present with, your whole self in the moment, i.e. <i class="calibre8">not</i> aware.</p>
<p class="indent">Moshe Feldenkrais said, ‚ÄòIf the person, while he is listening, while he is thinking and looking, is judging at the same time saying, ‚ÄúThis is good, this is not good. That‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs not it‚Äù‚Ä¶ at this precise moment he interrupts the ability of his awareness to see clearly and correctly.‚Äô Feldenkrais went on to describe a child, like the baby perhaps, experiencing something and being totally absorbed in it without judging or comparing:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindentl">It is impossible to divert his attention: he just looks and sees what he sees. And that attracts his whole attention. It is the ability to observe while he is listening to himself. He does not have any other <a id="page_77" class="calibre6"></a>attention. All his awareness is drowned in it‚Ä¶ that childish virtue is namely the ability to look at something without preparing the fixed mechanical feedback, but instead to illuminate what is found, to light it up in our awareness, to‚Ä¶ be nourished and sated by it without any prior deliberation and judgement.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn35" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn35" class="calibre6">35</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Feldenkrais is describing something very like that full engagement in the present I am proposing. It is also like Meisner‚Äôs recipe for full absorption that doesn‚Äôt leave space for worrying about being interesting or the character: ‚ÄòI begin with the premise that if I repeat what I hear you saying, my head is not working, I‚Äôm listening, and there is an absolute elimination of the brain.‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn36" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn36" class="calibre6">36</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">Another term we could use here is ‚Äòembodiment‚Äô. If you are not already familiar with this term it could sound nuts. Of course we are embodied. It just means ‚Äòin your body‚Äô, and clearly if we weren‚Äôt in some way in our bodies we would be dead. However, as a member of the audience, you appreciate that an actor who seems comfortable and ‚Äòalive‚Äô on stage often seems ‚Äòcomfortable in their skin‚Äô ‚Äì a phrase we all know ‚Äì and you can easily spot an actor who isn‚Äôt. Even in life you will be able to differentiate between people who really seem to live in their bodies and those who seem in some way uncomfortable or simply not present in theirs: stuck in their heads or sort of ‚Äòelsewhere‚Äô. But there are many levels between these extremes that include most of us in some way. It comes back to having a kinaesthetic sense of ourselves, the sixth sense that I discussed in <a href="chapter_07_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#4OIQ0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 1</a>, whereby we feel a connection to what we do, so that in any moment we are fully, physically present: alive on stage, not ‚Äòdead‚Äô. It is awareness that roots you in yourself rather than separates you from yourself.</p>
<div class="box">
<p class="noindentb" id="ind20"><a id="page_78" class="calibre6"></a><b class="calibre7">Shifting Attention</b></p>
<p class="noindentb1">As you are reading your attention is on the lines of the book. Keep reading but shift your attention to:</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Your pelvis/sit bones on the chair and whether you are on the back or front of it/them.</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> Your breath as it flows in and out, and the places that move as you breathe: your ribs, belly, back.</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> How your feet are resting on the floor?</p>
<p class="listb"><span class="sp">‚Ä¢</span> What you can hear elsewhere in the house or outside the window?</p>
<p class="noindentb1">You can listen to many things inside and outside of you while you read. All of these things are part of being present while you are busy doing something. It‚Äôs not so important when you are reading, but it is very important when you are playing a sport, fighting, dancing, singing, acting, etc.‚Ä¶</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Practising listening to yourself while doing something (like that child Feldenkrais describes), not only enables you to learn, but creates a different kind of relationship to yourself in life and on stage. In a Feldenkrais lesson we foreground and focus awareness for learning. In acting or in life, it operates more as a constant background. I remember my own first experiences of Moshe Feldenkrais‚Äôs work through the teaching of his colleague Monika Pagneux. I could only describe it afterwards as the sense of having been plugged in. I could feel myself and my connection to everyone and everything else in a totally new and vibrant way. There was less in the way of myself. A new possibility for freedom of action and spontaneity that carried over into my life and my work.</p>
<p class="h"><a id="page_79" class="calibre1"></a>Awareness</p>
<p class="noindent">It is no contradiction to say that you need awareness on stage, that sense of being plugged in ‚Äì but not self-consciousness, not those nagging thoughts and judgements about what you are doing. You can see the difference very clearly in the martial arts. In a much revered ancient Chinese ‚Äòbible‚Äô of martial arts teachings called the Bubishi, there are six principles, a number of which are relevant to acting. One of them is this: ‚ÄòTechniques will happen in the absence of conscious thought.‚Äô A ‚Äòtechnique‚Äô here means a block, punch, kick, throw, take-down, etc. You train to perfect them for hours, weeks, months and years, with a lot of careful attention to exactly how you do it in a variety of ways. It is a very precise art. But when you are doing any kind of sparring, or preparation for sparring, you cannot be acting out ideas, consciously thinking about and judging what you are doing: that slows you down! You need to be able to respond immediately. You have to, very simply, be aware of yourself, the space, the other person, and just act. You have to trust that all the training you did is there. You must be very alive to what is happening, respond in the moment and just do it: otherwise you will not respond to what is actually happening at the time in an appropriate way and you will lose a point, get hit or be taken down. In a real fight that could mean you die for real. It is very similar for an actor who also risks ‚Äòdying‚Äô on stage. It is that total absorption in doing without judgement that the child in Feldenkrais‚Äôs example has. I repeat: this does include awareness of yourself and everything and everyone around you. It‚Äôs just not self-consciousness.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn37" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn37" class="calibre6">37</a></sup></p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindentl">And you have to train ‚Äì so when you want it it‚Äôs there and when you want to move, you are moving and when you move, you are determined to move‚Ä¶ If I want to punch I am going to do it, man, and I am going to <i class="calibre8">do</i> it. So that is the kind of thing you have to train yourself into‚Ä¶ to become one with the‚Ä¶ you think ‚Äì and snap!</p>
<p class="right"><i class="calibre8">Bruce Lee</i><sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn38" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn38" class="calibre6">38</a></sup></p>
</div>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page_80" class="calibre6"></a>Another principle of the Bubishi that applies to actors as well as martial artists is: ‚ÄòAct in accordance with time and change‚Äô ‚Äì in other words, act according to what is happening at that moment and how the situation is changing. Be aware of the flux in the dynamic between you, the other actors and the audience as it occurs ‚Äì don‚Äôt just act in accordance with what you think would be impressive/interesting/funny, or would show your best profile, or worked last time. Only act in response to the other person. Another good Meisner principle.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn39" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn39" class="calibre6">39</a></sup> It‚Äôs all there too in a Feldenkrais lesson. Feel what is happening <i class="calibre8">now</i>. Respond to that. Explore that. Don‚Äôt just try and do your idea of what the movement should be. It means nothing.<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn40" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn40" class="calibre6">40</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">All this doesn‚Äôt mean to say that there is no place at any point for analysis, conscious thought and discussion. There may well be plenty in your preparation for the role during rehearsals, or in learning technique too. It‚Äôs just that once you are up there performing or in the throes of improvising or trying something out, you can‚Äôt be thinking in that way. I remember having a session with a student who was struggling with her character in a scene. She had tried many techniques and paid good attention to a lot of aspects of her role: going through everything the character said or everything said about them in the play; noting the given circumstances of the scene; actioning the scene; being a weasel; being mercury; finding the psychological gesture ‚Äì all sorts. All had thrown up good and useful discoveries in different ways. But what she wasn‚Äôt doing when she came to do the scene, was letting go of that work and just being there and responding in the moment. She was busy with all the ideas she now had about the part, and it was getting in the way. I ended up only allowing her one line of text and then provoking her and pushing her around (literally, because in the scene this is what was happening to her subtextually) until she could no longer ignore me and do her thing on her own, but suddenly unconsciously connected her text directly to the annoyance I was provoking in her. Now she actually responded to what I was doing and what she <a id="page_81" class="calibre6"></a>wanted me to change in my behaviour there and then, rather than to her idea of the character. And when she did she was very good; all her hard work was there informing it. Having technique in the end really means having had enough experiences to be aware of the possibilities so you can respond appropriately in the moment. But notice once again: that <i class="calibre8">does</i> involve awareness. In this situation, as long as she shut herself off from her awareness and stayed in her conscious thinking, nothing happened, but once she let herself tune in to herself and be aware of what was going on between us ‚Äì once her head got out of the way ‚Äì it just flowed, but it was still contextualised by all the work she had done.</p>
<p class="indent">It is like what George Mann said on his experiences of learning with Jacques Lecoq: ‚ÄòWhen I try too hard, when I think too much about it, I‚Äôm not trusting that instinctual part of myself that just knows, that learnt it. My body learnt it. I need to trust that part of myself. I need to let go and stop trying to control everything.‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn41" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn41" class="calibre6">41</a></sup></p>
<p class="indent">So we are talking about awareness as a level of engagement of the whole of yourself in what is going on. An ability to listen and respond and adapt as the moment changes, rather than a self-conscious kind of brain activity that keeps you somehow outside of what is going on. And this awareness is always needed. You need it to learn, and it‚Äôs absolutely what Meisner, and anyone else worth their salt, is after so that you can be present and ready to play.</p>
<p class="h">Complicit√©: Being Present with Other Actors</p>
<p class="noindent">Moshe Feldenkrais based a lot of his work on the idea that human beings are very good at adapting to changing circumstances. It‚Äôs what, at our best, we do better than any other species and why we have been so successful. In a Feldenkrais lesson, you go back to a more fundamental level. What you are engaging in and listening to is yourself, the sense of the movement within <a id="page_82" class="calibre6"></a>yourself and your changing relationship to the ground and the space. Being present and listening to yourself in this way is also a helpful precondition for being present with and able to listen to anyone else. A useful term popularised by Jacques Lecoq for this ability to be present with others is ‚Äò<i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i>‚Äô.</p>
<p class="indent">Philippe Gaulier, with whom I studied in my late teens/early twenties, had a wonderful phrase for actors who couldn‚Äôt be present in this way: ‚ÄòYou are acting in your own corridor.‚Äô It was a much-dreaded phrase. It meant you were so far away from actually acting <i class="calibre8">with</i> the other actors that you were not even in the same room as them. You were in the corridor outside, doing your own thing, on your own. It would shortly be followed by Philippe suggesting to his neighbour in an audible whisper that they might like to leave and go to the bar instead. Drama (or comedy) on stage doesn‚Äôt usually happen as a result of two people saying or doing things totally independently of each other. The drama is in what happens <i class="calibre8">between</i> them in the given situation. Stanislavsky says the same thing in a different way. You do something <i class="calibre8">to</i> someone. To affect someone. You don‚Äôt just do it in a vacuum for the sake of doing it. Meisner: ‚ÄòWhat you do doesn‚Äôt depend on you, it depends on the other fellow.‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn42" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn42" class="calibre6">42</a></sup> But in my experience you often see an actor who has carefully ‚Äòactioned‚Äô<sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn43" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn43" class="calibre6">43</a></sup> every line or phrase proceed to play the thing according to the ‚Äòactioning‚Äô, without any reference to the other actor, or with any sense that he or she might need to adapt their responses to what the other actor is doing. At that moment the actor is firmly in their own corridor. It is not at all what Stanislavsky intended, and it is unlikely to be what the actor intends, but it can be what happens all too easily. <i class="calibre8">Complicit√©</i> is listening and responding to and playing with the other actor: what happens in that exciting place of possibilities between people when they are engaged with each other.</p>
<p class="indent">There are many fine books on this topic, but what is important to us in this book is the link between <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i> and the awareness that I was discussing. Being present with yourself <a id="page_83" class="calibre6"></a>and being able to listen to what is happening in the moment, and to the changes and fine differences as they happen in movement, extends to being able to listen to changes and fine differences in what is happening between you and someone else. It will make you more sensitive to more subtle changes in their voice, their behaviour, and to have that range available with which to respond. John Wright makes the point that Feldenkrais asks you to be in <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i> with yourself, to listen to yourself and be responsive to what you are invited to do ‚Äì which in turn helps you be in <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i> with someone else on stage. As Feldenkrais says himself in a recorded conversation with actors of Peter Brook‚Äôs Centre for International Theatre Research and El Theatro Campesino in 1973:</p>
<div class="block">
<p class="noindentl">What does increased sensitivity mean? It means telling the difference between minor increments or decrements in minor changes. It means you become sensitive to the little lead that your partner gives you, to the change in your own voice, to your partner‚Äôs voice, you become more sensitive, more differentiated, more awake.</p>

<p class="noindentb1"><i class="calibre8">One of you come on to the stage and find a place to stand and look at the audience.</i> Do nothing more than that. Very simple.

<p class="noindent">The interesting question in the above game is: what got in the way of you or your fellow actor‚Äôs ability to be simply present without doing? How comfortable were you? What parts of you did you not know what to do with? Could you breathe easily? Where was the weight on your feet? Did you want to shift or wriggle? Did your eyes fix or wander? Did your mouth tighten? Did you feel tension in some places? What did your fingers do? Did you feel a rising desire to get off stage or do something? Did you see any of that in your fellow actors?</p>
<p class="indent">And why is it important to notice those things?</p>
<p class="indent">One reason is because, if you are busy with your own discomfort on stage, it is harder for you to be present with us and so for us to watch you. When we feel your difficulty with being present, it makes us uncomfortable in turn. We might not want to be present either, and we might wish to follow Philippe Gaulier to the bar! John Wright has a lovely version of this game (which he in turn developed from an exercise used by Copeau and which I know from teaching with John), in which the audience go a step further and provide a spoken commentary of what they see going on in the person onstage. Of course, it may not actually be the person‚Äôs <i class="calibre8">real</i> story or anything they are actually thinking, but it is what the audience is getting from their presence. But it is also interesting to do without the commentary so the actor onstage doesn‚Äôt have anything from the audience to respond to. It‚Äôs the total opposite of Meisner giving you an activity. It drops you right <i class="calibre8">‚Äòdans la merde</i>‚Äô (‚Äòin the shit‚Äô), as Philippe Gaulier would say.</p>
<p class="indent">In that way it tells us something very simply and clearly about how well we can read you and what your chances are of being able to communicate what you want to us. Monika Pagneux, Peter Brook and others talk of the actor‚Äôs transparency: a simple <a id="page_85" class="calibre6"></a>openness to the audience that enables what is inside the actor to be seen outside. I will come back to this idea in a later chapter, but I brought it in here as a simple extension of being able to be present with yourself and so with the audience. It is important to appreciate that the difficulties that the previous game may have revealed will be part of what you do onstage or on camera that will get in the way of whatever you want to communicate to us. The inside cannot transmit to outside because there is too much interference, too much internal ‚Äònoise‚Äô for you to be really present with us and for us to hear you.</p>
<p class="indent">This background interference (or ‚Äònoise‚Äô) is often what makes it harder for the actor to hear themselves and their fellow actors, which in turn makes it harder to be responsive to the impulse to do something that could arise from the simplicity of just being there and quietly listening to themselves, the audience and their fellow actors. They are not in contact, not in <i class="calibre8">complicit√©</i>, on their own in their own corridor, outside the real play. They have lost awareness. They are all self-consciousness. We will look at some of what causes this ‚Äònoise‚Äô in <a href="chapter_13_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#AFM60-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 3</a>.</p>
<p class="indent" id="ind30">Remember what you saw and what you felt in <i class="calibre8">Being Present with the Audience</i>, and try it again after doing <i class="calibre8">Lesson 5: The Pelvic Clock</i> at the end of <a href="chapter_12_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#9H5K0-a90a7afdeb3b44c3b8154838eaa839e5" class="calibre6">Part 2b</a>. Because, in my experience, the difficulty of just simply being present is pretty much <i class="calibre8">always</i> helped by ‚ÄòAwareness Through Movement‚Äô (ATM). This is the name Feldenkrais gave to the lessons he taught to groups. The sections entitled ‚Äòlessons‚Äô in the book are all classic ATM lessons (or parts of lessons), and some of the games contain little moments or particular aspects of an ATM too. In an ATM we don‚Äôt have to deal with an audience, with other actors, with a situation, with a text or having to come up with an improvisation. In some ways, the pressure is off. You are not being judged, don‚Äôt have to make anyone laugh, are not being scrutinised by colleagues or audience. All of this can help free you from your habitual ways of coping. You are often lying down in a lesson so all your habitual ways of keeping your balance and staying <a id="page_86" class="calibre6"></a>upright are not an issue either. You don‚Äôt have to deal with anything except tuning in to yourself and exploring the movement you are being asked to explore. It is a deliberately safe place where it feels easier to risk letting go, be spontaneous and find something new. The only risk is not getting out of the way enough to allow yourself to become aware of your habits and learn that you really do have other possibilities. To be very present with yourself. And that can be enough of a challenge all on its own.</p>
<p class="indent">I hope you will now appreciate that we are talking about an awareness that involves the whole of you, not a self-conscious way of thinking led by a disembodied brain. Monika Pagneux did not like the word ‚Äòwarm-up‚Äô for what an actor does to prepare. She called it a <i class="calibre8">wake-up.</i><sup class="calibre11"><a id="ifn44" href="chapter_26_Feldenkrais for Actors.html#fn44" class="calibre6">44</a></sup> She was right. You have to wake up to yourself, to the situation, to the environment, to the other people on stage and in the audience. You have to wake up, feel, listen and be present.</p>
