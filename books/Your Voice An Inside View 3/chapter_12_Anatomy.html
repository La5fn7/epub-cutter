<h1>Anatomy</h1>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>The human body is a wonderful machine. At once simple and complex, it is capable of an extraordinary range of movement and action. In everyday life, the physical actions required for respiration and phonation exist beneath our conscious control‚Äîthey occur more or less automatically. Singing, however, requires active thought and disciplined control of these physical processes. The source of this control lies within the interactions among the muscles and organs of respiration, phonation, articulation, and hearing, all directed by the most important singing organ of all: the brain.</p>

<p>Think for a moment about the physiological complexities of simple conversation. The process begins when soundwaves strike the eardrum. The vibrations of sound are transferred via the auditory ossicles to the cochlea of the inner ear for transformation into nerve impulses. These impulses then are sent to the <em>auditory</em> area on the left side of the brain for interpretation as sound. Next, the process moves to the <em>sensory speech </em>area where the sound is interpreted as language. The response is formulated in the <em>motor speech</em> area, which hands the process over to the <em>motor cortex</em>, which sends the detailed instructions to the muscles of breathing, phonation and articulation.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs get a bit more specific for a moment. Imagine you have been asked a question, such as ‚ÄúAre you thirsty?‚Äù To form the one-word answer ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù your brain must tell your body to:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Open the glottis to permit inhaled air to flow into the lungs;</li>
	<li>Contract the inspiratory muscles to induce inhalation;</li>
	<li>Induce exhalation through relaxation of inspiratory muscles and gentle contraction of expiratory muscles while simultaneously closing the glottis to make the vocal folds vibrate in the moving stream of exhaled air;</li>
	<li>Lift the soft palate to ensure that no air escapes out the nose;</li>
	<li>Move the tongue into a forward position in the mouth for the creation of the initial phoneme /j/;</li>
	<li>Slide the tongue a little backward for creation of the vowel /Œµ/;</li>
	<li>Open the glottis to end phonation while maintaining a gentle stream of air;</li>
	<li>Lift the jaw and raise the tongue to produce the sibilant consonant /s/;</li>
	<li>Stop the flow of air and return the tongue and jaw to their resting positions.</li>
</ol>

<p>Believe it or not, the nine steps listed above are an extremely simplified representation of what occurs during the production of vocal sound. The details will be supplied by the next several chapters of this book.</p>

<p><strong>Anatomical Views</strong></p>

<p>Study of the anatomy and physiology of singing requires an examination of the skeletal, muscular and nervous systems. In this study, you will be looking at images of anatomical structures viewed from a variety of perspectives or <em>aspects</em>. It is important to understand the naming system applied to these views. If an object is seen from the front, it is in an <em>anterior</em> aspect; if observed from the back, it is a <em>posterior</em> view. (<em>Ventral</em> and <em>dorsal</em> are alternate terms for anterior and posterior.) A side view is termed <em>lateral</em>, while above and below are <em>superior</em> and <em>inferior</em>, respectively.</p>

<p>Within the body, if a structure or movement is toward the head, it is said to be <em>cranial</em> (alternately <em>rostral</em>); away from the head is <em>caudal</em> (literally ‚Äútoward the tail‚Äù). <em>Medial</em> and <em>lateral</em> indicate location toward and away from the center of the body, respectively. Something on or toward the surface of an object is <em>superficial</em>; something away from the surface is <em>deep</em>. Separate nomenclature is used for the extremities (e.g. arms and legs) where <em>proximal</em> relates position toward the body and <em>distal</em> refers to away from the body.</p>

<p>You also will be viewing cross-sections of objects through several planes of reference. An object that is cut in two through the anterior/posterior plane is viewed in <em>sagittal</em> section. A slice through the medial/lateral plane yields a <em>frontal</em> or <em>coronal</em> section (alternately <em>longitudinal</em>). A horizontal slice‚Äîlike the wound caused by a <em>guillotine</em>‚Äîprovides a <em>transverse</em> or <em>horizontal</em> section, which may be viewed from the superior or inferior aspect. Physiological structures also may be seen <em>in situ,</em> whole, in their original place, or in <em>dissection</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Types of Muscles and their Actions</strong></p>

<p>All muscles in the human body exclusively work through contraction. This fact has direct pedagogical consequences; for example, many singers and teachers would like to believe they can use their diaphragms actively to push air out of the lungs (‚Äú<em>Support from the diaphragm!‚Äù</em>). Unfortunately, this is a physiological impossibility. The diaphragm performs its work‚Äîits contraction‚Äîduring inhalation. It is generally passive during exhalation, making little or no contribution to breath pressure or air flow.</p>

<p>Nearly all muscles in the body are symmetrically paired. For example, we have two <em>biceps</em> and <em>triceps</em>‚Äîone for each arm (not to mention the two <em>gluteus maximus</em> muscles upon which you probably are sitting as you read this sentence). Most muscles of the larynx, head, neck, jaw, thorax and abdomen are paired as well. The diaphragm and the <em>procerus</em>, which lies between the eyebrows and contracts during a frown, are the only two unpaired muscles in the entire body.</p>

<p>Many muscles also work interactively with each other to help control bodily movements through the principle of <em>muscular antagonism</em>. Muscular antagonism occurs when two or more sets of muscles contract in opposing directions. For example, to hold the arm steady in an outstretched position, the biceps gently contracts to bend the forearm toward the body (flexion) while the triceps exerts a resistive pull in the opposite<em> </em>direction (extension). Muscular antagonism is important in breathing for singing, where the muscles of inspiration are contracted to resist the action of the muscles of expiration, resulting in increased control of breath pressure and air flow. It is also used to help control pitch and loudness in singing and to stabilize the position of the larynx.</p>

<p>Three types of muscles are found within the human body:</p>

<ul>
	<li><em>cardiac</em></li>
	<li><em>smooth</em></li>
	<li><em>skeletal</em></li>
</ul>

<p>Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart. It is <em>involuntary</em>, meaning its contraction cannot be consciously controlled. We can, however, gain a degree of control through indirect means; the rate of heart contractions can be increased through exercise or decreased through conscious relaxation. Cardiac muscle is composed of long, striated fibers that are extremely resistant to fatigue.</p>

<p>Smooth muscle is similar to cardiac muscle in that it is involuntary. It does not, however, share the striated structure. It is found primarily in the blood vessels (veins and arteries) as well as the certain organs such as the stomach, intestines and bronchial tubes (Zemlin, 1998).</p>

<p>The muscles of phonation, respiration and articulation are all skeletal muscles. Like cardiac muscle, skeletal muscles consist of striated fibers (they are often simply called <em>striated</em> muscles). Unlike cardiac and smooth muscle, skeletal muscles are under voluntary control through the peripheral nervous system. Voluntary control, however, does not necessarily mean <em>direct</em> control. Many muscles, such as the previously mentioned biceps and triceps, can be consciously or deliberately contracted very easily‚Äîwe simply choose to flex the muscle. Other muscles, such as those responsible for wiggling the ears, must be discovered or learned. Still others, such as the intrinsic muscles of the larynx, only can be controlled through indirect means. For example, pitch is raised by stretching the vocal folds longer and thinner. Physiologically, this is accomplished through contraction of the <em>cricothyroid </em>muscles. We cannot consciously contract these muscles; however, we voluntarily make them contract whenever we choose to raise pitch.</p>

<p>Skeletal muscles are told to contract by impulses sent through the nervous system. Some muscles respond very quickly to these signals and are therefore called <em>fast twitch</em>. Others respond more leisurely and are referred to as <em>slow twitch</em> muscles. Muscles also vary widely in their resistance to fatigue. The diaphragm, for example, contracts at least 25,000 times per day without getting tired. Imagine how the muscles of your legs would feel after walking the same number of steps!</p>

<p><strong>Muscle Names</strong></p>

<p>The muscles of the body receive their names through a variety of ways. Some are labeled by their overall shape, others by their location or function, and still others through their points of attachment. Zemlin cites the following general categories:</p>

<p><strong>geometric names</strong> examples include the <em>deltoids</em> (triangular-shaped muscles of the shoulder), <em>trapezius</em> (trapezoidal-shaped muscles of the neck) and <em>quadratus lumborum</em> (rectangular-shaped muscles of the lower back);</p>

<p><strong>general form</strong> examples include the three <em>serratus</em> muscles of the torso (saw-like) or the <em>longus</em> and <em>brevis</em> (long and short) portions of the <em>levator costarum</em> (costal elevator) muscles;</p>

<p><strong>locations in the body</strong> such as the <em>intercostal</em> muscles that lie between the ribs, the <em>subclavian</em>, which is found under the clavicle and the <em>frontalis</em>, which is located over the frontal bone of the skull;</p>

<p><strong>descriptive terms</strong> such as <em>major, minor, external, internal, orbicularis </em>(encircling), <em> oblique</em> (at an angle), <em>transverse</em> (from side to side) or <em>rectus</em> (up and down). Descriptive terms are used in conjunction with another term such as the <em>external oblique abdominis</em> <em>muscles</em> (expiratory muscles of the abdomen);</p>

<p><strong>number of heads</strong> these muscle names reflect the number of attachment points at their origin and include such muscles as the <em>biceps, triceps </em>and <em>quadriceps</em> (two, three and four, respectively);</p>

<p><strong>attachments</strong> muscles in this category are named by their points of origin and insertion. Examples include the <em>sternocleidomastoid</em> muscles, which arise from the sternum (<em>sterno</em>-) and clavicles (<em>-cleido-</em>) and insert into the mastoid process of the skull, and the <em>cricothyroid</em> muscles, which arise from the cricoid cartilage to insert into the thyroid cartilage. In this naming system, the point of origin always comes first. Contraction of these muscles draws the point of insertion closer to the point of origin;</p>

<p><strong>function</strong> these muscles are named according to their general function, such as the <em>depressor anguli oris</em> (depresses the corner of the mouth), <em>levator palati</em> (lifts the soft palate), or <em>risorius</em> (creates the smile).</p>

<p>We can add one additional item to the above list: muscles that are named because of what they are. Our chief example is the diaphragm; it is called the diaphragm because <em>it is</em> <em>a diaphragm</em>‚Äîa barrier between two regions formed by a membrane (in this case, a large, thin muscle). So, if you ever have trouble remembering the name of a muscle, think about the categories listed above to help jog your memory.</p>
