His multimedia voice science and pedagogy textbook,&#160;<em>Your Voice: An Inside View</em>, is used by well over 100 colleges and universities throughout the United States and abroad. Deeply committed to education, McCoy is a founding faculty member in the New York Singing Teachers Association (NYSTA) professional development program, teaching classes in voice anatomy, physiology and acoustic analysis.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; As a singer, McCoy performed more than two dozen leading operatic roles and over 60 concert and oratorio solo roles with professional music organizations in the United States and abroad. In addition, he is a specialist in the song cycles of Schubert and Schumann, and frequently concertized with pianists Claude Cymerman and J.J. Penna, and self-accompanying on piano and guitar.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Dr. Halstead‚Äôs interests in laryngology, swallowing, voice, performing arts medicine and pediatric otolaryngology led her to create the MUSC Voice Center in 1987. In 2000, the Voice Center expanded, and she became the Medical Director of the MUSC Evelyn Trammell Institute for Voice and Swallowing. Every year, Dr. Halstead acts as a laryngologist for the internationally renowned Spoleto Festival USA. She lectures nationally and internationally on the topics of laryngopharyngeal reflux disorders and pediatric voice and swallowing disorders.

<p><strong>Lynn Helding</strong> serves as Coordinator of Vocology &amp; Voice Pedagogy and studio voice teacher at the USC Thornton School of Music. Ms. Helding is a thought-leader within the dynamic field of contemporary voice science, or&#160;<em>vocology</em>, and thus was elected to head the founding of the first non-profit vocology association,&#160;PAVA. She is an associate editor of the&#160;<em>Journal of Singing</em>&#160;and creator/author of the journal‚Äôs ‚ÄúMindful Voice‚Äù column, which illuminates current research in the cognitive, neuro- and social sciences as they relate to music teaching, learning and performance. She is in demand as a master teacher and popular lecturer on cognitive topics at universities, conferences and workshops across the United States and Canada.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Helding‚Äôs stage credits include the title role in the first American production of Luigi Rossi‚Äôs&#160;<em>Orfeo</em>, and leading mezzo-soprano roles with Harrisburg Opera, Nashville Opera, Tennessee Opera Theatre, and Ohio Light Opera. A deep commitment to art song led her to create&#160;<em>Made in America</em>, a narrative song recital of works by eighteen American composers which toured Italy, France, England, Germany, Spain, Australia and Iceland, and the theatrical performance piece&#160;<em>This is My Letter to the World</em>, a song recital which featured spoken fragments of Emily Dickson‚Äôs letters interspersed with Dickinson songs by composers Aaron Copland, Jake Heggie, William Bolcolm and Lori Laitman, which premiered at the Brook Center for Music in New York City. Her highlights in chamber music include the title role in Schoenberg‚Äôs Perrot Lunaire, broadcast on Nashville Public Television, and&#160;<em>Good Night</em>, written for Lynn Helding and the Baltic Philharmonic Chamber Orchestra by Icelandic composer Thorkell Sigurbjornnson, which premiered at Miller Theatre‚Äôs ‚ÄúNew Works‚Äù series in New York.</p>

<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Lynn Helding studied voice at the University of Montana, in Vienna, Austria, and at Indiana University, where she was the first singer ever accepted to pursue the prestigious Artist Diploma in Voice. She earned her master‚Äôs degree in vocal pedagogy from Westminster Choir College of Rider University and completed the&#160;Summer Vocology Institute&#160;of the&#160;National Center for Voice and Speech&#160;in Salt Lake City, where she has returned as guest faculty. Her voice teachers include Esther England, Dale Moore, and Chris Arneson, and voice science mentors Scott McCoy, Ingo Titze and Katherine Verdolini-Abbott. Previous to USC, she taught voice for four years at Vanderbilt University‚Äôs Blair School of Music, and more recently served twenty-two years as Associate Professor of Voice and Director of Performance Studies at Dickinson College.</p>
