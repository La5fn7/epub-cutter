<h1><strong>Brain</strong></h1>

<p>By Lynn Helding</p>

<h3><strong>The Pillars of Voice Science</strong></h3>

<p>Voice science has influenced voice pedagogy since the famous Spanish voice teacher, Manuel Garcia II (1805-1906) procured two dental mirrors, slid one into his mouth and aimed the other at just the right angle to catch a ray of sunlight, revealing the marvel of the human vocal folds. He subsequently published his paper, "Physiological Observations on the Human Voice " in the <em>Proceedings of the Royal Society of London </em>in 1855 ‚Äúin language which would have done credit to expert anatomists and physiologists,‚Äù according to his admiring student and biographer, Malcom Mackinlay. Garcia's publication permanently established an alternate track in the world of elite vocalism, a scientific track that was to grow in importance and influence from that moment on. As explained by musicologist and singer James Stark:</p>

<p>Garcia polarized the whole field of vocal pedagogy with his introduction of&#160;the laryngoscope, [and] with his theories... Garcia's vocal pedagogy became the concern not only of traditional voice teachers, but also of scientists and medical doctors.</p>

<p>Thus, voice <em>physiology</em> (the way in which body parts function) was established as the first pillar of voice science. Interest in voice science grew among vocal pedagogues throughout the first half of the twentieth century, but the field, like practically everything else in the Western world, was hobbled by two world wars. When the world finally emerged from these nightmares at mid-century, voice pedagogy, like many other academic fields, began to grow. In the 1970s, the Swedish voice scientist Johann Sundberg‚Äôs research on the acoustics of the singing voice revealed the special resonance cluster that male opera singers exhibit which allows them to be heard over an orchestra. Dubbed the ‚ÄúSinger‚Äôs Formant,‚Äù Sundberg‚Äôs discovery firmly established voice acoustics as the second pillar of voice science.</p>

<p>The 1980s brought the publication of two important voice books, Sundberg‚Äôs <em>The Science of the Singing Voice </em>and Richard Miller‚Äôs<em> The Structure of Singing. </em>The 1990s saw Ingo Titze‚Äôs <em>Principles of Voice Production </em>as well as significant contributions by Oren Brown, Meribeth Dayme Bunch, Barbara Doscher, and Robert Sataloff. While many of these works largely concerned voice physiology, the interest in vocal acoustics first generated by Sundberg had also caught fire. Works such as Donald Miller‚Äôs <em>Resonance in Singing </em>book and its companion computer voice analysis program <em>VoceVista,</em> Kenneth Bozeman‚Äôs two books on ‚Äúpractical voice acoustics,‚Äù and Titze‚Äôs work on the <em>nonlinear source-filter</em> model of voice production, and the use of semi-occluded vocal tract postures, have all significantly advanced our understanding of voice acoustics and vocal tract resonance.</p>

<h3><strong>The Missing Mind</strong></h3>

<p>From this brief summary of the ascent of voice science, it is apparent that the twin pillars of voice physiology and voice acoustics created a firm foundation for the field of voice <em>pedagogy</em>, defined as the art and science of teaching. This fact‚Äîthat pedagogy is about teaching, or more pointedly as professor of education Deborah Loewenberg Ball once commented, ‚ÄúTeaching depends on what other people think,‚Äù makes it all the more ironic that what has been missing from voice pedagogy until very recently is both the delivery system and the receptacle for voice science information: the human mind.</p>

<p>The fund of voice science knowledge that has accumulated since Garcia‚Äôs time is rich with insight about the human voice. This bounty inspired pedagogue Richard Miller to admonish singers to ‚Äútake advantage not only of everything that was known 200 years ago, but also of everything that is known today.‚Äù The most urgent questions for those who rise to this challenge are ‚ÄúHow? How might I gain this knowledge, and more importantly, how might I apply it to singing?‚Äù Answering these questions requires understanding how humans learn.</p>

<p>Learning is the vital question of <em>cognitive science</em>, an interdisciplinary science that arose when the Cognitive Revolution of the 1950s swept aside <em>behaviorism</em> as the dominant field in psychology. Learning itself is not a single entity, but a complex activity comprised of many interrelated processes. Cognitive science, built upon the foundation of psychology, reflects this complexity by including neuroscience, artificial intelligence, linguistics, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy to study human perception, thinking and learning. We may now turn to cognitive science as the third pillar in the field of voice pedagogy.</p>

<h3><strong>Two Basic Modes of Learning</strong></h3>

<p>The ancient Greek philosophers identified two primary sources of human knowledge: knowledge that is gained by exercising the human attribute of reason, or <em>rationalism, </em>and knowledge gained through sensory experience, known as <em>empiricism. </em>This dichotomy is still reflected in standard modern learning theories, despite the terms used to describe them. Two of the most accepted are <em>declarative learning </em>and <em>procedural learning; </em>in philosophy, these two modes are identified as <em>know-that </em>and <em>know-how.</em> Declarative learning (know-that) is information that one can speak about, or ‚Äúdeclare.‚Äù The construction ‚Äúknow-that‚Äù refers to knowledge of facts<em>, </em>as in ‚ÄúI know that a formant is a resonance of the vocal tract.‚Äù This kind of knowledge is not innate; it has to be ‚Äúdeclared‚Äù to the learner and is best elucidated by an expert teacher as a guide. Declarative learning typically takes place over a time period of days, weeks or months. Memory for words and life episodes also fall under declarative learning.</p>

<p>Procedural learning (know-how) refers to learning physical skills (procedures) by doing and is inclusive of both those innate movements with which we are born, like crawling, to advanced skills, like learning to ride a bicycle or learning to play a musical instrument. The field of study dedicated to research in procedural learning is called <em>Motor Learning, </em>wherein ‚Äúmotor‚Äù refers both to motion and to the <em>motor neurons</em> (brain cells) that create movement.</p>

<p>Procedural learning in humans begins almost from birth. We are, one might say, pre-programmed to learn to grasp and crawl, and walk all on our own as toddlers, which we do by trying, falling, and trying again; no teacher is necessary. Acquisition of the physical movements needed for survival advance relatively quickly, usually in a matter of hours. Thus, a crucial difference between declarative learning and procedural learning is the speed with which each adheres.</p>

<p>However, advanced muscular skills, (also called <em>higher order</em> muscular tasks), like those on display in a concert pianist, do not come pre-installed in humans, but must be learned via a combination of declarative and procedural learning. Singing displays this dual nature: we explore the range and extent of our own voices by wailing, giggling and cooing as babies. As we mature, we can easily find our own singing voice, particularly if our surrounding culture provides for it and supports it; family sing-alongs and community singing in religious services provide just these opportunities. Many singers of popular styles report these experiences as formative, and rightfully claim to be self-taught.</p>

<p>However, those wishing to learn the Western, classical tradition of singing‚Äîwhich is distinguished by a large pitch range, sustained breathing, natural amplification, seamless register shifts and agile execution of rapid scale passages‚Äîmust first be led by a master teacher as guide, and then must practice with regularity and discipline. Similarly, singers of contemporary commercial styles (CCM) who wish to extend their vocal range, stamina and control, should consult a voice teacher if they wish to excel.</p>

<p>These kinds of singing styles are considered <em>high order</em> tasks, more complex and refined than generic voicing. Higher order and complex muscular tasks all have one attribute in common: they all require practice over time. The amount of practice time required to become an expert is estimated to be about ten-thousand hours. This number was arrived at by combining over a century‚Äôs worth of studies by multiple researchers. K. Anders Ericsson, a founder of the field of expertise studies, further identified that the quality of practice required to become an expert is even more crucial than simply logging practice hours. He dubbed this high-quality type of practice <em>deliberate practice</em>, defined as ‚Äúan effortful activity designed to improve individual target performance.<em>‚Äù </em> Higher order muscular tasks are situated at the nexus of declarative and procedural learning: we must first <em>know that</em> in order to <em>know how. </em>The following chart illustrates the standard synonyms in use for declarative and procedural learning, and their attributes.</p>

<h5><strong>Learning Defined</strong></h5>

<p>Learning has been the most assiduously studied topic in psychology, from its inception as a field in the early nineteenth century and throughout the twentieth. Schools of thought and their resultant vocabularies sprang up around the world, yet in the face of the subject‚Äôs enormity, and without the connective power of the Internet, the creation of a commonly accepted definition of learning was nearly impossible. In the twenty-first century, the ability to view the brain‚Äôs inner workings in real time via <em>functional magnetic resonance imaging </em>(fMRI), and the rapid dissemination of digital information have generated only more information, not more clarity toward a definition of learning.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, we will need a definition to work with if we are to understand some fundamental properties of learning. Therefore, two simple definitions for each of the modes of learning are offered here, based on the most common elements found in accepted learning theories.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>BOX 2</strong></h3>

<div class="kbContent" style="padding: 10px;">
<ul>
	<li><strong>Declarative Learning:</strong> a process that results in a permanent change in behavior as a result of <strong><em>experience. </em></strong></li>
	<li><strong>Procedural Learning:</strong> a process that results in a permanent change in behavior as a result of <strong><em>practice.</em> </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>&#160;</p>
</div>




</div>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Notice that both definitions are exactly the same, except for the crucial factor which causes each type of learning to adhere, or, ‚Äúcause a permanent change in behavior.‚Äù In the case of <em>declarative learning,</em> if the information presented is easily understood,<em> </em>it is enough to simply be introduced to a topic to be able to claim it as learned. For example, in this book‚Äôs chapter on respiration, it may have been news to you that the diaphragm muscle is attached to the bottom of the sternum and is therefore more highly situated in the body than many people imagine. If that information held particular meaning for you, you are not likely to forget it. However, other types of declarative information contained in this book, such as the names, locations and functions of all the other respiratory muscles, must be studied in order to be truly learned. And as any student knows, studying facts to the extent that they can be successfully recalled for an exam requires motivation and diligence. Thus, a key attribute of declarative learning that distinguishes it from procedural learning is <em>volition</em> ‚Äì the learner must want to learn.</p>

<p>Conversely, procedural learning requires doing. No substitutions are viable. Procedural learning of basic human skills occurs concurrently with the development of <em>proprioception</em>, the body‚Äôs own sense of its movements, positions, balance and <em>spatial orientation</em><strong><em> </em></strong>(where it is in relation to other people and objects). Learning these most fundamental human physical skills is largely <em>non-volitional; </em>we learn them by experiencing the world, thus the learning will occur whether we wish it to or not, as a matter of survival. Procedural learning and declarative learning exhibit significant differences regarding speed of acquisition and volition. But both types of learning share certain commonalities, which we will consider next, before returning to their differences.</p>

<h5><strong>How Learning Works: The Triumvirate of Attention, Learning and Memory</strong></h5>

<p>The human brain has been called the most complex system in the known universe. Exactly how humans learn is still not completely understood, but at present, it is accepted that learning is not one discrete entity, but rather a three-step process of <em>attention, learning itself,</em> and <em>memory.</em> These three phases display their own attributes and attend both declarative and procedural learning. A very simplified scheme of these phases is offered for reference as we consider both the psychological and neurobiological processes that underpin our most fundamental and complex activity: learning. (see Box 3)</p>

	<li><strong>Step One | Attention</strong>: This is the prerequisite condition for learning. Learning cannot happen until and unless one first pays attention. Note: attention has a limited capacity in the human brain.

<p>&#160;</p>

<h5><strong>Step One: Attention</strong></h5>

<p>Attention is the prerequisite condition for learning, but what is it, exactly? Attention is a complex neurological system distributed throughout the brain via a connected neural network, not a single entity. The attention is network best understood as an attentional filtering system, called the <em>autonomic nervous system (ANS), </em>which incessantly sifts the information that bombards our senses every second, parsing the important from the trivial. As explained by Stanford neurobiologist Robert Sapolsky, the <em>autonomic nervous system </em>is essentially distributed between two systems: The <em>sympathetic nervous system</em> (SNS) and the <em>parasympathetic nervous system</em> (PNS).</p>

<p>The SNS, borne from the <em>bottom-up</em> or intuitive response, is primed to alert in the presence of danger or excitement, such as sexual arousal. This alerting operates rapidly, and largely outside our awareness and control. Some typical body signs that the SNS is fired up are increased heart rate, shortness of breath, weak knees, loss of appetite and sweaty palms. The SNS is linked to the <em>fight-or-flight</em> response, which is the impulse to stand one‚Äôs ground in the presence of danger, or flee.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the SNS is also operational in times of purely psychological stress, such as the disorienting experience of <em>music performance anxiety</em>, or MPA. Apparently, the SNS does not always differentiate between a hungry animal bearing down on you in the wilderness and a full house in a concert hall. Several recent international studies of professional musicians indicate that the incidence of MPA is widespread; estimates vary from 55% to has high as 70%. But a vexing question regarding MPA is whether it is a condition unique to music performance per se, or is a manifestation of a broader psychopathology.<strong> </strong>At present, MPA remains vastly understudied (especially in comparison to anxiety in sport performance), as does the efficacy of certain treatment methods.</p>

<p>The <em>parasympathetic nervous system</em> (PNS) operates from the <em>top-down, </em>or <em>executive control </em>center of the brain, and works to calm the body after fear, flight or arousal, and restore it to a resting state. Executive attention governs conscious control of attention (also called <em>selective attention</em>), which is what allows us to filter out the most important bits from the wealth of stimuli that assaults our senses from moment to moment. We can choose attention by exerting the human parameter of free will, but only when inspired to do so by desire and motivation. Thus, a subgenre of attention research is a condition called <em>pre-attentive processing</em>, which is a particularly significant component of voluntary attention. Committed learners will want to know how they might prime their attention for success, before they enter a learning situation.</p>

<h5><strong>Desire and Motivation</strong></h5>

<p>Learners must first want to pay attention before they truly can. Desire and its twin, motivation, are both the simplest yet most elusive of conditions for learning, as anyone who has tried to commit to a study schedule, exercise routine, or diet can attest. Before we consider what does work to ignite motivation, let us quickly dispense with a popular yet ultimately counterproductive method: the use of rewards, such as candy, praise, or money. Research has shown that such rewards are not the primary forces that stimulate human endeavor and creativity. Rather, most humans are more stimulated by so-called ‚Äúintrinsic‚Äù rewards‚Äîfor example, the joy found in pursuing the endeavor itself, the excitement of discovery, and the freedom of charting one‚Äôs own course.</p>

<p>One of the best techniques shown to ignite motivation is <em>goal-setting,</em> the conscious act of listing one or several goals which one wishes to reach. Goal-setting has been shown in the short run to stimulate motivation, and in the long run, to actually increase achievement. Goal-Setting works in part by concretizing vague notions of achievement. It also promotes focus, cultivates self-regulation by aiding impulse control, and helps calibrate efficient use of time and financial resources. These various benefits accrue to promote positive feelings‚Äîwhich in turn, feeds more motivation.</p>

<p>Four of the most important parameters to consider if using this technique are <em>specificity, format, difficulty</em> and <em>process.</em> In order: 1) goals must be very specific rather than general, 2) written down (not merely kept in mind) and 3) challenging, not easy; (note that this factor echoes Ericsson‚Äôs definition of <em>deliberate practice). </em>Finally, 4) goals must answer the question ‚ÄúHow‚Äù? One study reported that students who were required to answer this last question by listing exactly how they intended to achieve their goals were more likely to succeed.</p>

<h5><strong>Emotion</strong></h5>

<p>We have considered desire and motivation as the twin ignition systems of attention. But once attention is fired up, how does it keep going? One simple answer is, ‚Äúemotion.‚Äù But like everything else having to do with the human condition, emotion is far from simple. It is a vast and complex topic, as well as an age-old conundrum; emotion has bedeviled human beings for as long as we have been sentient. Aristotle‚Äôs (384‚Äì322 BCE) term for emotion was <em>path√©</em>, variously translated as ‚Äúdesires‚Äù or ‚Äúappetites.‚Äù During the seventeenth century, Ren√© Descartes recognized the physiological upheavals generated by these appetites as ‚Äúpassions of the soul‚Äù and attributed this agitation to the pineal gland in the brain, which he believed to be home base for the human soul. Eighteenth century beliefs about emotion were particularly influenced by romantic thought, which regarded emotion as a natural and raw human attribute which, enchained by propriety, longed to escape its fetters. This take on emotion persisted throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries and is still present in popular culture today.</p>

<p>In the early twentieth century, emotion experienced a kind of banishment at the hands of behaviorist psychologists, who eschewed emotion as far too frivolous for serious scientific study. The cognitive revolution chipped away at behaviorism, and eventually displaced it by ushering in the current era of brain science; but the pioneers of cognitivism in the 1950s had as much interest in emotion as their predecessors, which is to say, almost none.</p>

<p>Throughout most of the twentieth century, rational thought was exalted as the pinnacle of human wisdom, while emotion was not only deemed worthless as a serious research topic, it was branded as downright seditious: emotion bewitched and muddled rational thought. Emotion is still commonly viewed as an element that one must tame, silence, or outgrow.</p>

<p>Yet the very newest research on emotion from the field of neuroscience reveals that emotion, rather than being rationality‚Äôs polar, frivolous opposite, is fundamentally entwined with human reason. Neuroscientists like Antonio Damasio, Jaak Panskepp and Joseph LeDoux have worked to repair the mind-body split proposed by Descartes by plucking emotion from the ephemeral realm of the spirit and grounding it within the physical functions of the body. Emotions, according to LeDoux, are solidly defined as ‚Äúbiological functions of the nervous system.‚Äù Damasio, through his now famous <em>somatic marker hypothesis, </em>has advanced emotion as a critical component of human decision-making and thus an assistant to reason ‚Äì a far cry from its centuries‚Äô old characterization as a fickle temptress. ‚ÄúEmotion,‚Äù Damasio notes, ‚Äúis not a luxury.‚Äù</p>

<p>Emotion plays a critical role in sustaining attention during learning, for emotion necessarily attends motivation and desire. Unless a person cares enough to expend some effort, he will not learn because he will not have ‚Äúattended.‚Äù</p>

<p>Emotion also assists encoding our experiences into long-term memory (a process called <em>memory consolidation) </em>particularly if the emotions were strong ones. Joyful life episodes, like one‚Äôs wedding day or elation at the birth of a child, become permanently fixed in our memory. It is perhaps for this reason that extreme technical breakthroughs in a voice lesson, or superlative achievements reached in performance, are deeply remembered.</p>

<p>On the other end of the emotion spectrum, extremely frightening or humiliating events can become so encoded in memory that certain stimuli, especially smells and sounds, can activate the ‚Äúalerting network‚Äù of the autonomic nervous system. Harmless sounds like fireworks can recall a war veteran‚Äôs memories of enemy fire with devastating consequences for mental health, as is seen in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Even the scent of a certain aftershave or a personal ringtone on a cell phone, if they are entangled with memories of particularly brutal or humiliating events, can engender symptoms of PTSD. Please note, however, that emotion‚Äôs role in attention, learning, and memory has been qualified as necessarily ‚Äústrong‚Äù in order to assist. Tripping during a stage entrance, or enduring the tirade of a nasty conductor, as unpleasant or unwarranted as such events might be, do not encode themselves in the long-term memories of most people, nor to such a degree as to cause long-term damage.</p>

<h5><strong>Sleep</strong></h5>

<p>Along with desire, motivation, and emotion, a final parameter to consider in regard to attention is <em>sleep.</em> Sleep is understood by researchers as a complex set of brain processes, not a single state of being. It is well established in science research that lack of sleep impairs brain function, damages learning, weakens performance in cognitive tests, and slows reaction time for physical tasks that require alertness, like driving and operating heavy machinery. Yet the underlying, biological reasons why sleep deprivation is so damaging, and conversely, why abundant sleep is so restorative, are still something of a mystery. Several studies offer some clues.</p>

<p>An important sleep study in 2013 revealed that sleep may be critical for what amounts to brain cleaning. According to these researchers, the brain lacks the conventional version of the <em>lymphatic system</em> (which clears cellular debris out of the body) so it evolved its own metabolic system, the <em>glymphatic system</em>, which operates during sleep to flush away waste products accumulated during wakefulness that are toxic to brain cells. According to this theory, the uncluttered and detoxified brain should rise from sleep refreshed and more able to pay attention.</p>

<p>Another theory concerns <em>synaptic pruning</em>, the processes by which synapses<em> </em>that are weak (due to lack of attention and practice) wither away with no trace in the brain, leaving only the strongest synaptic connections behind. It is believed that sleep is the state most conducive to this pruning process, because the brain is least subject to interference from incoming stimuli. A related theory is that the purpose of sleeping and dreaming is to replay short-term memories gathered throughout the previous day and in so doing, strengthen the neural pathways of those memories and send them along their journey to long-term <em>memory consolidation,</em> which we will revisit in depth in Step Two: Learning. But before we leave the topic of attention, we must consider a relatively recent cultural phenomenon known to be toxic to attention: <em>multitasking. </em></p>

<h5><strong>Attention and Multitasking</strong></h5>

<p>The term <em>multitask </em>first appeared in the nascent computer technology of the 1960s, but since the advent of the worldwide web in the 1990s, the word was absorbed into the popular lexicon. While multitasking per se has been a part of human activity for millennia, the current manifestation of the term <em>multitasking</em> refers to the mingling of one or more technology-based tasks: reading email while listening to music, texting while watching television, or driving a car while following a GPS. Research on human multitasking in the digital environment has zeroed in on the following parameters:</p>

	<li><strong>Attentional Filtering</strong>: the ability to successfully filter relevant from irrelevant information</li>
	<li><strong>Task-Switching</strong>: shifting from task to task, and/or returning to an important task after distraction by a task of lesser importance</li>
	<li><strong>Organization of Thoughts</strong>: keeping cognitive results organized for later retrieval (note: This is a hallmark of learning; a thing cannot said to be learned if it cannot be retrieved and repeated.)</li>
</ul>

<p>Multiple studies have shown that the vast majority of people manage all these parameters extremely poorly when faced with digital distractions. This is due to our limited attentional capacity. Stated simply: it is very difficult for people to pay deep attention to more than one thing at a time.</p>

<p>Because multitasking is toxic to attention, it also degrades learning itself. Multitaskers demonstrate decrements in their ability to engage in higher levels of thinking, such as analytical reasoning. And even if a learner is able to muster some attention while still multitasking, the learned thing acquired in this fraught state has been shown to be less flexible, making later retrieval more difficult. As we shall see, retrieval is proof that a thing is learned.</p>

<p>Worse, habitual multitasking makes our attentional abilities degrade over time. An influential series of studies conducted at Stanford University showed that the more chronic a person‚Äôs multitasking habit, the less possible it was for them to ignore irrelevant distractions. The term ‚Äúacquired attention deficit disorder‚Äù and ‚Äúattention deficit trait‚Äù have been introduced by two psychiatrists, John Ratey and Edward M. Hallowell respectively, who posit that heavy technology use may be actually creating attention deficit disorders in people not otherwise disposed toward them. It appears that we can remodel our brains both for good and for ill.</p>

<h5><strong>Step Two: Learning Itself</strong></h5>

<p>As the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle wrote in his treatise <em>Metaphysics</em>, ‚ÄúIf you are learning, you have not at the same time learned.‚Äù This simple statement perfectly captures two important facets of learning: first, its essence, which is its dynamic nature. That is, learning is marked by change, even instability. Learning is messy. If approached with a no holds barred, spirit of adventure, learning can be fun. But learning can also be challenging to the point of joylessness, distress or even humiliation. Nevertheless, learning is a fundamental‚Äîsome say <em>the</em> fundamental‚Äîactivity of life.</p>

<p>Yet given learning‚Äôs dynamic nature, we cannot always be in a state of upheaval and transition. Learned items must be stowed, in order to make way for new experiences and ideas, and also for later retrieval. Thus, once learning has progressed from the transitive to the past tense (as in, ‚ÄúI have learned‚Äù), one is no longer actively learning. The second facet of Aristotle‚Äôs astute observation is realized; the learned thing is a fait accompli, stored in <em>long term memory</em>. This process‚Äîfrom ‚Äúlearning‚Äù to ‚Äúhave learned‚Äù‚Äîis called <em>memory consolidation</em>.</p>

<p>Much research is devoted to this storage process, from the moment new information is absorbed and held in mind for a period of seconds, called <em>short-term memory, </em>to how this information is then sorted and manipulated while actively learning, called <em>working memory.</em> Some researchers refer to this process as <em>maintenance,</em> and <em>maintenance plus manipulation, </em>respectively. For our purposes, let us think of <em>short-term memory</em> like a brain-pad of sticky-notes‚Äîa place to temporarily jot down impressions or facts. And just like a collection of those small bits of paper, they may be easily misplaced if we are not attentive to them.</p>

<p><em>Working memory</em> may be thought of as learning itself: that process whereby we are able to hold several bits of information in mind (and that includes sensory information in motor learning), as we toss those bits about, consider or try them from different angles, and recombine them with facts we already know, and experiences we have already had, in order to make sense of them. Here is this last sentence restated in more compressed fashion so as to allow in one new piece of information:</p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Box 5</strong></h3>

<div class="kbContent" style="padding: 10px;">
<p style="text-align: center;"><em>Learning itself is that process whereby we hold about seven bits, or four chunks&#160;of information in mind, manipulate those bits or chunks, and recombine them&#160;with facts or experiences we already know.</em></p>

<p>&#160;</p>
</div>




</div>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;">&#160;</p>

<p><em>Working memory</em>, or <em>learning,</em> is a process which starts as we consider a few bits of information‚Äî‚Äúseven (plus or minus two),‚Äù the compound number famously posited in 1956 by George Miller, a founder of cognitive psychology‚Äîand more recently understood as <em>chunks</em> of information, of which we seem to be able to manage around four. Let us consider how this works.</p>

<p><em>Working memory</em> is what is allowing you to read this chapter and hopefully learn from it. As your reading progresses, your success is partially dependent upon the ability to maintain the information from the previous paragraphs in your mind; each successive paragraph can build on the next only by your understanding of the former. For example, if you have been reading with attention, you know that we are now considering step number two of the learning process, learning itself. Step one was the topic of <em>attention</em>, with side trips featuring bits of information, all related to the main topic of <em>attention. </em>As such, we may call the topic of attention a <em>chunk,</em> made up of mini components. Researchers have invented a new verb‚Äî‚Äúchunking‚Äù‚Äîto describe this process. Chunking itself is the subject of much research and seems to be a key talent possessed by people with superior memories. However, all of us can learn to use chunking to improve learning and develop superior memory techniques.</p>

<p>One final component of learning from the last line of our definition in Box 5 deserves mention: the notion of <em>recombination.</em> As we have already seen, learning begins with <em>attention,</em> followed by absorbing new bits information into our <em>short-term memory</em>, then using <em>working attention</em> to manipulate those bits, and finally storing those bits in <em>long term memory.</em> But no learner is a blank slate; and our individual slates become more populated with ideas and experiences as we navigate our lives. We call these ideas and experiences <em>memories.</em></p>

<p>Any process of absorbing new information will necessarily collide with our previous memories, so in order to calm the collision and make sense of it all, we recombine the new information with the memories we already own. This dynamic moment in the learning process is called <em>constructive memory. </em>The main benefit of constructive memory is its cumulative quality ‚Äì we use past experiences to change our actions in the present, and also to imagine the future. We learn from our mistakes. But detriments due to constructive memory abound, chief among them being memory‚Äôs fallibility. It is now known that human memory is enormously prone to distortion and outright error. Since what we encode in memory is always mixed up with what we already know (or think we know), our memories are never completely pure. As our memories pile up, our minds create frameworks to keep them organized. These frameworks are called <em>schemas. </em>A schema may be defined as a cognitive structure for representing, organizing and retrieving related information. Schemas (also called <em>schemata</em>) are particularly important in motor learning.</p>

<h5><strong>Step Three: Memory</strong></h5>

<p>The complex neurobiological process of learning itself is encoded in the well-known maxim called Hebb's rule: "<em>Neurons</em> (nerve cells) that fire together, wire together." Recall that learning begins when the <em>synapses</em> (the gap between neurons) are excited by a thought or a sensation. With the addition of attention, emotion and desire, short term memory rapidly progresses to working memory‚Äîotherwise known as learning. As this nascent memory is manipulated, the already excited neural pathways are reactivated. Repeated reactivation of the same neurons (through repetition or practice) is what creates a neural pathway‚Äîa memory. The process of encoding working memory to long term memory is called <em>memory consolidation</em>; thus, memory may be considered synonymous with the term "learned."</p>

<p>Neuroscientist Eric Kandel was awarded a Nobel Prize in 2000 for his groundbreaking discoveries about the biological bases of this process. Kandel realized that short-term memory is not a diminutive version of long-term memory, as was previously believed, but is altogether biologically distinct. Short-term memories cause biochemical changes in the brain, indeed, by the release of neurotransmitters; but long-term memories cause anatomical changes in brain tissue, by increasing the number of synaptic connections. Kandel‚Äôs discoveries, which occurred in tandem with other significant brain research at the very end of the previous century, led to the astounding realization that the brain continually remodels itself. Before the 1990s, it was believed that the adult brain could not change much past childhood and was, by all accounts, fixed. But it is now accepted wisdom that brain cells <em>(neurons)</em> can regenerate <em>(neurogenesis)</em> and that the brain changes continually in response to experience. This process is called <em>neuroplasticity. </em></p>

<p>We have now considered what <em>declarative</em> and <em>procedural learning</em> share in common. To understand their differences, and specifically what cognitive processes undergird the attributes needed for mastering performance art, we turn to research in the field of motor performance and learning.</p>

<h5><strong>Motor Learning and Performance</strong></h5>

<p>As noted in the simple definitions in Box 2, the crucial factor which distinguishes declarative from procedural learning <em>practice.</em> More motor learning occurs with more practice. Two leaders in motor learning research, Richard Schmidt and Tim Lee, dubbed this ‚Äúthe Power Law of Practice,‚Äù while also conceding that this law is so obvious, it should not have to be mentioned ‚Äì which is true until one considers an astounding finding from motor learning research: performance improvements generally accelerate rapidly for novices, and generally decelerate the more experienced one becomes. That is, the rate of growth slows as motor performance improves. To make sense of this and other key findings from the field of motor learning research, let us start by considering a more complex definition of <em>motor learning: </em></p>

<div class="kInteractive container container425" data-kotobee="Tlg2SlBXFldGREdGUkpAWUpGXU5AVxdDDRoVHEpAWVVRXVALCktAREdGREpAWRsNHwdAVxcfREdGCyoKGw4aC0dXVwkAU0cZCR0VAgFRXVBfUAkAU0cECQsWAgETSlBXXxQVTVBGWg0dGQsRHTAEAUxQElBGWlVBR0pGXQAKF0FAEyIdDBsaTl1GVVNJQBcXAxoGDAoAKAAYABBAVxcfREdGSw4TCg4VDkdXVwkAU0cWDywdBwAGSlBXXwAXU1YSDgkUDQlRXVBJQBcXAxI7GA4RAhsNSlBXXxQJREdGCwAeBB1RXVBfQBcXQkZHW1xBWEpGXU5AVxdBCAYVCgMXPB0VHyQKF2hKAxwYDUpAWVUAHRcASQAXUxEdBUpAWVUaGg4JSQAXUxYYCRwBBQ4ZCkdXVx8AU0cXBwEGCgYaChBRVxAAU0dRXys=" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); width: 100%; height: auto; margin: 5px auto; clear: both; padding: 0px; border-radius: 3px; border-width: 1px; border-color: rgb(170, 170, 170); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
<div class="kbContent" style="padding: 10px;">
<p style="text-align: center;">Motor learning is a <strong>process</strong> that is <strong>inferred</strong> rather than directly observed,</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">that leads to <strong>permanent changes</strong> in <strong>habit </strong>resulting from <strong>experience or practice</strong>.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>
</div>




</div>

<p>There are many variations of this definition, but the most prominent ones accepted by researchers contain the six bolded components. The term <em>process </em>underscores the dimension of time. The acquisition and retention of physical skills occurs along a continuum. Temporary breakthroughs notwithstanding, progress does not happen all at once, but over a period of time.</p>

<p>That this process is <em>inferred </em>refers to learning‚Äôs dynamism, for learning itself can never be directly observed; we can only assume it is happening and wait for proof that the learned thing has adhered. This proof shows up in two guises, the first being the relatively<em> permanent changes </em>that distinguish procedural from declarative learning. The second is that these changes are stable enough to be called physical <em>habits</em>, even under variable conditions<em>.</em> Finally, these conclusions are all based upon the supposition that the student will continue to <em>experience</em> sensations that he will then repeatedly <em>practice.</em></p>

<p>Now that we have made one pass through the complex definition of motor learning, the following components from this definition are worth even deeper inspection: <em>permanent changes</em>, <em>practice</em> and <em>habit</em>,<em> </em>respectively. As we do so, it is important to note the essential difference between learning and performance.</p>

<p><em>Learning</em> is the process by which one acquires skill or knowledge. Remember: learning is dynamic, unstable, and messy. <em>Performance </em>refers to the manner or quality with which someone functions. Performance is like the freeze-frame button on a video projector ‚Äì it captures where the learner stands at that point in time along the learning continuum. Because of this frozen quality, most of us want our performances to be as polished as we can manage‚Äîthe opposite of unstable and messy. In other words, the goals of learning and performance are‚Äîand should be‚Äînot just different, but diametrically opposed. When these goals are conflated, both learning and performance may suffer.</p>

<h3>Performance Shifts: Master Class Syndrome</h3>

<p>The evidence that a motor skill is truly learned is its repeatability, and under many different conditions. These two parameters are called <em>retention</em> and <em>transfer,</em> respectively. Without proof that the learning has been retained, we can only say that the learner was merely exposed to the information. What about changes observed during training that are not permanent? Motor learning researchers call these changes <em>performance shifts, </em>and they can be both positive and negative. Motor learners can absorb powerful lessons from both. Let us begin with positive performance shifts.</p>

<p>Most singers are familiar with the phenomenon of instant success upon a first or second trial, which may occur in the midst of a voice lesson or solo practice session, but then vaporize moments or hours later. This phenomenon may occur in weekly singing lessons, especially if the student feels that she never sings as well in her own practice or performance as she does in her lessons. This phenomenon is particularly common in a one-time master class setting, in which a guest master teacher is able to evoke a positive vocal response from the singer on display, but only in that moment. The student is at a loss to re-capture that magical moment later in his own practice. These are prime examples of positive performance shifts, and while these positive experiences may have been significant for the student, lacking the proof of retrievable, permanent changes, real learning cannot be said to have occurred. I have dubbed this phenomenon ‚Äúmaster class syndrome,‚Äù and counsel students to run, not walk, to the practice room immediately following a successful experience. There is some evidence that by doing so, it is possible to recreate the experience for oneself.</p>

<p>What is revelatory, and perhaps even shocking, is that habitual manipulations by coaches or teachers that improve performance in the moment may actually stifle long-term learning. Why is this? Part of the answer lies with one factor we have already considered in tandem with practice: effort.</p>

<p>Research into the biochemistry of the brain reveals that the more difficult a task is, the more ‚Äúneuronal firing‚Äù from our brains is required; in essence, we must dig deeper for more complicated tasks. Repeated firing of the neurons from this deeper place creates a neural pathway which becomes stronger each time it is activated during learning. As we have seen, this is the explanation of what happens during <em>working memory</em>, and the neuroscientific definition of <em>practice</em>. With enough practice, difficult tasks become easier and eventually, if mastered, are stored in long term memory.</p>

<p>Cognitive psychologist Robert Bjork labeled such tasks ‚Äúdesirable difficulties,‚Äù because obstacles must form the foundation of any viable teaching method, especially if the goal is true learning and not simply improved performance in the short-term. Researchers have concluded that the solutions<strong> </strong>learners discover for themselves, through effort, are truly learned and are thus retained and retrievable. This explains why withholding ‚Äúdesirable difficulties‚Äù may actually damage learning.</p>

<p>Performance shifts can also be negative, brought on by illness, depression, or injury. But negative performance shifts may also signal the phenomenon of <em>unlearning, </em>posited by researchers P. G. Zanone and Scott Kelso. This theory holds that when someone is attempting to learn a new motor skill, there may be a simultaneous destabilization of the previous, habitual motor pattern. This is both good news and bad news. The bad news is that unlearning can cause psychological distress. In addition, musicians should note that multitasking and task switch cost may be particularly toxic to motor learning, due to unlearning. If distractions are allowed to poison attention during this crucial phase of learning, the learner may wind up in a lose-lose situation: the new task attempted is certainly not gained, but the old, comfortable habit may become damaged as well. For example, a baritone who transitions to tenor may wager he has nothing to lose in the attempt; he assumes the familiar voice will always be there, just like an old pair of jeans (or Colline‚Äôs old coat in <em>La Boh√®me!)</em> Such singers may be distressed to find that, after a time, the old habit no longer ‚Äúfits‚Äù‚Äîyet the new technique does not fit either, for it has not yet stabilized. Therefore, this particular juncture in motor skill learning appears to be particularly vulnerable. Musicians would do well to ban distraction from the practice room and pay total and complete attention to the task before them.</p>

<p>On the whole though, negative performance shifts can be seen as positive signs that a new, learned skill is actively destabilizing an old, ingrained habit. Exactly how the destabilized habit becomes a stable new skill occurs via the last component of our complex definition of motor learning: practice.</p>

<h5><strong>The Path to Carnegie Hall</strong></h5>

<p>‚ÄúHow do I get to Carnegie Hall?‚Äù the hapless New York City tourist asks. ‚ÄúPractice!‚Äù goes the punch line. This is Schmidt and Lee‚Äôs ‚ÄúPower Law of Practice.‚Äù We must add to this power law that quantity and quality matter: specifically, ten-thousand hours of high quality, deliberate practice, marked by effortful engagement with desirable difficulties are required to become an expert. Motor learning researchers study many discrete parameters of practice, and while the results are numerous, the following three essential rules of effective practice for motor learning can be gleaned from them.</p>

<h5><strong>1) Distributed practice is more effective than massed practice</strong></h5>

<p>People whose regular practice sessions alternate with periods of rest retain more than piling information on all at once in mega-practice sessions. Even more compelling is the finding that the longer the rest session is in between practice sessions, the better the learning, as evidenced by both retention and transfer in later performance. This could be at least partly due to the cognitive benefits of sleep, as previously noted. What this means for musicians is: practicing every day for one hour proves much more beneficial than practicing twice a week for three and a half hours per each session, even though the total number of hours per week are the same.</p>

<p>An added benefit of <em>distributed, </em>or <em>spaced practice </em>is protection from injury. Athletes studied in motor learning research are more at risk for injury during massed practice. Why is this? The answer is quite simple: massed practice without rest leads to muscle fatigue, and tired muscles are more vulnerable to injury.</p>

<p>A side note here is that too <em>little</em> practice also makes musicians and athletes vulnerable to injury, due to lack of fitness. Musician guilt over lack of preparation may feed pre-rehearsal panic that in turn, fuels the desire to mass practice. Therefore, distributed practice is not only cognitively beneficial for learning, it is a sensible strategy for developing a safe and healthy vocal training regimen and has the added potential for keeping anxiety levels in check.</p>

<h5><strong>2)</strong> <strong>Varied practice is more effective than constant practice</strong></h5>

<p>This rule of practice is about conditions of practice and is somewhat dependent upon whether the skill one is practicing already displays an inherent amount of variability (called an <em>open skill task)</em> versus one that does not <em>(</em>a <em>closed skill task).</em> Examples are downhill skiing, in which conditions are constantly varied, versus bowling, in which the setting is fairly predictable.</p>

<p>Learning to sing is an inherently open skill task; variability is built in to the endeavor. Consider the trajectory involved with learning a singing role from beginning to opening night: there are vocal technique lessons with a teacher, coachings with a pianist for style and diction, staging rehearsals with a director, and dress rehearsals with a conductor and an orchestra. All of these carefully rehearsed parameters may yet be varied again by costumes, makeup, and jitters in front of a live audience. Clearly, honing one‚Äôs craft as a performer involves doing so under quite a lot of variable conditions.</p>

<p>How does this relate to the second rule of effective practice? Recall that the evidence that a thing is learned is its repeatability, and that a goal of motor learning is that the task remains repeatable even under variable conditions. So, the second rule of practice means that variation in practice, while potentially unnerving, is actually quite good for learning ‚Äì so good, in fact, that it not only strengthens the task at hand, but has been shown to positively boost other, related skills. This latter effect is called <em>generalizability</em> in motor learning research. So, the next time you feel thrown off by a change in venue, or the new timbres encountered with orchestral rather than piano accompaniment, embrace these variations as vitamin packs for learning that boost both the target skill itself, as well as the many related skills needed for performance. This type of multitasking is anything but toxic to learning!</p>

<h5><strong>3) Randomly ordered practice is more effective than blocked practice.</strong></h5>

<p><em>Blocked practice </em>focuses on training one movement over and over again until mastery is gained. The use of blocked practice is a popular method for inculcating discrete skills that make up complex activities, particularly when training beginners. For example, singers may be required to practice vocal onset exercises over and over again in middle voice range until glottal onsets disappear. While this method may seem to make common sense, <em>randomly ordered practice </em>has been shown over decades of motor learning research to be more effective for long term learning than blocked practice. That is, our singer will ultimately be more successful at clean onsets if she practices vowel onsets interspersed with onsets featuring voiced and unvoiced consonants, and onsets at variable pitch levels, than if she were to practice each of these components in repetitive isolation.</p>

<p>Note the use of the phrase ‚Äúlong term learning,‚Äù which highlights an interesting twist regarding this rule of practice: blocked practice actually boosts performance in the short term, that is, during the skill acquisition phase. This explains the one condition in which blocked practice is probably preferred, and that is for rank beginners. But if testing the viability of such boosts in real-world performance venues is delayed or avoided altogether, blocked practice can eventually lead to a false sense of accomplishment, for both student and trainer. Such musicians make excellent ‚Äúpracticers,‚Äù but fall apart in performance. The salient point here is that both <em>randomly ordered practice </em>and<em> practice under varied conditions </em>degrade immediate performance but boost long term learning as evidenced by superior <em>retention</em> (memory) and <em>transfer</em>, because they hold up in many different situations.</p>

<h5><strong>Controlled versus Automatic Processes</strong></h5>

<p>An ancient distinction has existed between things we do with conscious attention, and those things we do automatically. In motor learning, these modes are called <em>controlled</em> versus <em>automatic</em> processing, respectively, and these modes have received quite a lot of attention over the past two decades. The resulting research has painted a mixed picture, with strongly held views on both sides. A similarly mixed picture, with equally strongly held opinions, can be seen in the field of voice pedagogy, between those who promote a technical, or science-based approach, and those who prefer more intuitive methods.</p>

<p>Teaching methods that employ specific, frank instructions, such as ‚Äúlift your soft palate as you ascend in pitch,‚Äù or ‚Äúengage your abdominal muscles as you crescendo‚Äù are examples of directives that evoke controlled processing. In contrast, <em>automatic processing</em> does not call attention to these mechanics. Teachers who use a combination of emotion (for example, a stifled sob), imagery (‚Äúimagine an inflatable swimming ring around your middle‚Äô) or allusion to common physical gestures (‚Äúinhale through a yawn‚Äù) are evoking automatic processing.</p>

<p>Many voice teachers use a combination of controlled and automatic directives.</p>

<p>Regardless of which directives are used, in a typical voice lesson, singers are being showered with <em>feedback,</em> an essential part of motor learning, of which two types have been identified: <em>augmented feedback</em> and <em>biofeedback.</em> Biofeedback is nonverbal in nature and includes<em> </em>sensory information that the performer feels directly himself, as well as auditory and visual information delivered through a device: a mirror, a video camera, an audio recording or computer voice analysis.</p>

<p><em>Augmented feedback </em>is any type of instruction given from teacher to student and according to Schmidt and Lee, it exerts such a powerful influence on motor learning it is second only to practice itself. Due to this power, feedback has received a lot of scrutiny in motor learning research. We shall consider a few facets of feedback, before we return to the <em>controlled</em> versus <em>automatic</em> processing controversy.</p>

<p>Feedback frequency (how often a voice coach should provide augmented feedback) is one of several parameters studied by scientists. A common-sense approach, backed up by scientific research, is for teachers to provide frequent feedback in the early stages of vocal study and as mastery increases, this feedback should decrease, especially in light of what we now know about how immediate performance gains depress long-term learning.</p>

<p>Another consideration is <em>timing</em>; is augmented feedback best utilized by the student <em>terminally</em> (after the lesson) or <em>concurrently,</em> while the singer is engaged in singing? This question is especially important when considering computer-aided display devices, such as VoceVista, which operates in ‚Äúreal time‚Äù; in fact, it is this feature which its proponents tout as an advantage for use in the voice studio. Results from studies in motor learning have yielded varied results on the question of timing, but the following seem to be the most effective forms of feedback, in ranked order.</p>

<p><em>Immediate augmented feedback</em> (verbal commentary from teacher to student provided during the lesson) is the most effective feedback timing. <em>Terminal feedback</em> is also effective; this is feedback given after a period of time has elapsed. Also, learners can provide their own&#160;terminal feedback, for example, by self-evaluation through journaling. This kind of feedback can receive a boost if paired with goal setting.</p>

<p><em>Concurrent augmented feedback</em>‚Äîa stream of verbal coaching while the student is singing, or an overdependence on spectrographic feedback‚Äîshould be used sparingly. Besides distracting the learner from the ability to receive her own sensory information (biofeedback), concurrent augmented feedback also displays the troublesome characteristic of potentially boosting short term performance but depressing real learning. Note that spectrographic feedback used for research, or to target specific vocal phenomena, do not bear this caution.</p>

<p>A cautious note is in order regarding the physical feedback known as <em>manipulation. </em>This is literally the ‚Äúhands-on‚Äù teaching approach in which the teacher touches a student‚Äôs body in order to elicit a physical and/or tonal response. Ethical and legal considerations aside for the moment, the evidence suggests that manipulative correction sometimes follows the same outcome as controlled processing and concurrent augmented feedback: such solutions may temporarily benefit performance, but ultimately may not take root in the singer‚Äôs long-term memory. Nevertheless, anecdotal evidence does suggest that the immediate benefit from manipulation techniques may be retained if the learner can encode the desired sensations in their own memory banks.</p>

<p>Regarding the ethical and legal considerations of teacher-to-student touching: the potential for misunderstanding, misuse and/or outright abuse among both parties is high, particularly if there are no witnesses present. This is often the case in one-on-one studio teaching, where student and teacher are alone, behind closed doors. Teachers should be aware that simply asking permission to touch a student may not be enough, due to the asymmetrical power dynamic inherent in the teacher/student relationship; students may not feel free to say ‚Äúno.‚Äù For their part, students should know that they have the fundamental human right to forbid touching ‚Äì even if doing so creates awkwardness or anxiety. Yet despite these significant concerns, physical guidance or manipulation remains a very useful tool for motor learning. Therefore, a simple and sensible solution to these dilemmas is for the teacher to demonstrate upon her own body, never directly touching the student, but guiding the student acting in mirror imitation upon his own body. Another solution is for the teacher to give written instructions for what to do as homework (literally ‚Äúput your hands here‚Äù), followed by what the learner should seek (‚ÄúNotice when the spine is aligned that the jaw tends to relax‚Äù).</p>

<h4><strong>The Theory of Attentional Focus </strong></h4>

<p>Expert athletes, dancers, instrumentalists and singers all share the central objective of <em>muscular efficiency,</em> the ability to enact fine movement with the least amount of energy necessary for the task. Other common motor learning goals are <em>accuracy, speed,</em> <em>consistency </em>and especially,<em> automaticity. </em>The mark of the expert is said to be that their performances are achieved automatically, outside of their conscious awareness, and this view has gone unchallenged until very recently.</p>

<p>A goal linked to automaticity is that motor skills are best accomplished when the performer focuses on an external goal, rather than on internal mental processes. For example, in a dart task, people are much more likely to achieve success if they focus on landing the dart in the center of the bull's-eye than if they turn their attention inward to the mechanics of their movements, such as the best angle to hold the arm or the degree of flexion to rotate their wrist. This is known as the <em>theory of</em> <em>attentional focus.</em> An <em>external focus of attention</em> for motor tasks (the target), rather than an <em>internal focus of attention </em>(the mechanics), has shown strong positive results in lab studies, particularly athletic pursuits that feature balance, and those that feature manipulation of objects, like balls, clubs, darts and rackets.</p>

<p>As further evidence for the superiority of an external focus of attention, many studies have revealed that an internal focus of attention has been shown to actually harm motor learning and performance. When this occurs as a performance gaffe in front of an audience (like missing a putt in golf), it is known in both scientific and popular sports literature as <em>choking.</em> To explain the choking phenomenon, motor learning researcher Gabrielle Wulf developed the <em>constrained action hypothesis</em>,<em> </em>which holds that an internal focus of attention interferes with <em>automatic control processes.</em> Her hypothesis is based on the observation that automatic responses are accomplished much more rapidly than are consciously controlled ones; (refer back to Box #1 and note that declarative learning is generally slow while procedural learning is relatively fast). Since processing speed has been positively correlated with all of the goals of motor learning,<em> </em>the constrained action hypothesis<em> </em>holds that all of these parameters are harmed when performers slow down their own motor system by, in popular parlance, ‚Äúthinking too much.‚Äù Antidotes for choking are reflected in such popular sayings as ‚Äúdon‚Äôt overthink,‚Äù ‚Äústay out of your own head‚Äù and ‚Äúgo with the flow.‚Äù</p>

<p>The constrained action hypothesis has been expanded to include the observation that when performers are induced to think of their bodies during performance this triggers an internal focus of attention which begets a rapid spiral of self-evaluation, self-conscious-ness, negative emotion, and paradoxical attempts to stop all such thinking. Wulf and colleagues dubbed these spirals ‚Äúmicro-choking.‚Äù</p>

<p>It is important to note that choking of any type is directly proportional to ability: the more expert the performer, the more spectacular the mistake. In popular parlance, the higher you climb, the harder you fall. Experts choke, but beginners simply fail. Why is this? The answer lies in the performer‚Äôs abilities at the time of performance. Researcher Sian Beilock, an expert in motor learning research and the choking phenomenon, notes that beginners have no fund of procedural knowledge; we might say they have no flow with which to go. Because of this, Beilock notes that the early stages of learning may actually require an internal focus of attention, with a step-by-step approach to the mechanics of movement, until the learner has established the necessary motor patterns which allow him to put those learned skills on ‚Äúautomatic pilot,‚Äù thus freeing up the brain for other cognitive tasks.</p>

<p>Yet questions remain concerning attentional focus. At what stage in the learner‚Äôs journey might he abandon an internal focus for an external one? Do all advanced performers utilize an external focus of attention, and under all conditions? Have all motor pursuits been put to the test to determine whether an external focus of attention applies to all motor skills?</p>

<p>On this last question, prominent researchers like Wulf are so confident of the superior effectiveness of an external focus of attention that they claim this principle is generalizable to virtually every skilled motor pursuit, including music. This confidence is so ubiquitous that it has been dubbed ‚Äúthe Maxim‚Äù by dancer and philosopher Barbara Montero:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>Both in the ivory tower and on the football field, it is widely thought that focusing on highly skilled movements while performing them hinders their execution. Once you have developed the ability to tee off in golf, play an arpeggio on the piano, or perform a pirouette in ballet, attention to your bodily movement is thought to lead to inaccuracies, blunders, and sometimes even utter paralysis. At the pinnacle of achievement, such skills, it is urged, should proceed without conscious interference. ... Let me call the view that bodily awareness tends to hinder highly accomplished bodily skills ‚Äúthe Maxim.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>Recently, Wulf conducted a review of the extant research and concluded that in her overview of eighty different studies, ‚Äúin no case was an internal focus advantageous.‚Äù In addition to Wulf‚Äôs constrained action hypothesis, several more hypotheses were offered in support of the superiority of an external focus of attention.</p>

<p>One suggests that directing attention to mechanical movement actually causes existing muscular patterns to stabilize, thus working in opposition to the positive benefits of unlearning. A related theory involves the degree of freedom with which the body operates most efficiently and observes that an internal focus of attention seems to exert a ‚Äúfreezing‚Äù effect on the joints.</p>

<p>Another theory holds that analytical thinking, the province of the brain‚Äôs executive control center, processes information more slowly than the intuitive responses of our autonomic nervous system, and this slow pace impedes motor learning and performance.</p>

<p>Finally, the limitations of language have been noted as a barrier to motor learning, because of the difficulty in describing physical sensations in words. It is reasoned that poorly described sensations are, in essence, tracked into the non-motor regions of the brain where they are essentially ‚Äúlost in translation.‚Äù</p>

<h5><strong>Challenges to ‚Äúthe Maxim‚Äù</strong></h5>

<p>Recent challengers to ‚Äúthe Maxim‚Äù (Montero, Toner, Moran, Sutton et. al.) question whether all performers use an external focus in all situations, whether automaticity always attends higher order motor tasks, and if automaticity is even a goal valued by all expert performers in all domains. Their research is based in part on firsthand accounts of what expert instrumentalists, dancers, and athletes actually think about in real world performance situations. This is in stark contrast to previous research that has largely been carried out with non-experts, using simple motor tasks, and conducted under laboratory, not real-world conditions.</p>

<p>New research is finding is that many experts do exert executive control by issuing mechanical directives to themselves when engaged in high-skill activity. This is quite the opposite from operating automatically. Thus, challenges to the maxim are based on three key criticisms: 1) that research subjects are generally not experts, nor even very high-skilled performers 2) that lab studies do not (and cannot) study complex motor skills and 3) that studies conducted in a lab rather than on a court, on a mountainside, or in a theatre, are not ‚Äúecologically valid.‚Äù</p>

<p>An additional note is that very little motor learning research has been carried out on performance artists. This makes the automaticity account especially troubling, for the fundamental reason that automaticity may be desired in athletics, but absolutely not in performance art. In other words, taking risks in athletic performance may have dire consequences, from losing a championship match to broken bones. However, a goal for many artists is anything <em>but</em> automaticity; this is a particularly salient point for expert musicians, most of whom strive to keep their performances fresh and exciting and may even introduce an element of risk or improvisation to prevent well-worn repertoire from becoming stale. Yet a reasonable argument in favor of automaticity in performance art persists: firsthand accounts by successful performers do describe an automatic response to the nimble fingering required for executing rapid scale passages, and decrements ascribed to overthinking in this scenario.</p>

<p>A second challenge to automaticity as a valued goal involves performers‚Äô reactions to changed or changing conditions. For example, downhill skiers report the necessity and benefits of issuing technical commands to themselves (using an <em>internal focus)</em> during performance when changed snow conditions force them to be more strategic and less automatic. No one could argue that performance artists like singers, actors and dancers do not also face constantly changing performance conditions, from daily internal fluctuations like muscle fatigue and hoarse voice, to external changes such as humidity levels and performance space acoustics.</p>

<p>A third challenge to automaticity is the observation that the mark of an expert is the continual quest for improvement; the only way to improve is to counteract automaticity through deliberate practice. If we match this observation with the powerful finding from motor learning research mentioned at the beginning of this section (the rate of growth slows as motor performance improves), then we must conclude that the only way to improve after one has achieved an excellent level of ability is to design deliberate practice regimens featuring tasks of greater and more varied difficulty; until learned, these tasks would seem to require an attentional focus on mechanics. This last reason is cited by critics of the maxim when noting that an internal focus of attention is required when experts decide to radically alter ingrained habits in order to learn new techniques.</p>

<p>Current research on attentional focus in high level performers are offering powerful evidence that attention itself is trainable. Cognitive scientist John Sutton proposes the ‚ÄúAIR‚Äù approach: Applying Intelligence to Reflexes, defined as training that aims to develop ‚Äúdynamic repertoires of potential action sequences which can be accessed, redeployed, and transformed‚Äù in response to changing performance conditions. Exactly how this might be accomplished is also being scrutinized. Among the various techniques proposed are 1) contrast drills, in which the learner in training toggles back and forth between correct and incorrect movement and 2) developing a repertoire of cue words which operate as linguistic nudges intended to evoke desired actions (this is related to chunking). Sutton calls this process ‚Äúbuilding and accessing flexible links between knowing and doing‚Äù‚Äîthe very definition of how to build bridges between declarative and procedural learning.</p>

<p>Motor learning research on musicians is still in its infancy; practically none to date have used singers. Therefore, singers are encouraged to experiment with both <em>internal </em>and <em>external foci.</em></p>

<h5><strong>The Dance between Science and Art</strong></h5>

<p>Since Garcia first opened the possibility of using voice science to advance vocal art, voice science has influenced and even defined voice pedagogy. In doing so, Garcia unwittingly unleashed a historic schism between science and art in cultivated singing, between those who feel that science drains the mystery out of artistic singing, and those who believe that science can inform quality teaching methods based on physiological and acoustic facts. For singers and teachers who seek to practice a flexible and balanced approach between the two, the multidisciplinary field of cognitive psychology is proposed as the best arena for performing this dynamic dance between voice science and vocal art.</p>
